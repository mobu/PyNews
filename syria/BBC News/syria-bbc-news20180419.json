All hail the Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger!\" The post also contained a reference to the message board 4chan.\n\nImage copyright Facebook\n\n\"Incel\" is short for \"involuntarily celibate\" and in particular refers to online groups of men who feel that they can't enter into sexual relationships.\n\nThe attitudes of men who visit the boards vary widely, but online they frequently vent anger against sexually prolific men (\"Chads\") and women (\"Stacys\"). More generally, incel forums often include rants aimed at feminism and women.\n\nIn November, Reddit banned a section or subreddit of its site devoted to incels for hosting violent content.\n\nOn Tuesday, another subreddit dedicated to incels, r\/Malecel, was banned.\n\nHowever, other similar boards remain active on Reddit, and many other sites play host to incel discussions.\n\nImage copyright Reddit\n\nIncel forums also - albeit sometimes ironically - include praise for Elliot Rodger, who killed six people in the rampage through Isla Vista, California in 2014 before turning the gun on himself.\n\nRodger left a rambling manifesto detailing his sexual frustration and his hatred of women and minorities.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mourners left candles and messages on Yonge Street in Toronto after Monday's attack\n\nDo you have a story for us?

They restart it they're going to have big problems, bigger than they've ever had before.\"\n\n'Bigger, better' deal\n\nAnalysis by the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher\n\nThe visit was a strange mix.\n\nOn the one hand, a display of stark differences - Mr Macron almost channelling an anti-Trump in his opening admonition to resist \"aggressive nationalism\" and \"build a new multilateralism.\"\n\nOn the other hand, an overt display of deliberate chumminess punctuated with tussling handshakes and capped by the very odd dandruff episode, where Mr Trump seemed to hover between playfulness and aggression.\n\nBut whether or not the French president felt humiliated by the bout of unexpected grooming, he did manage to get Mr Trump's attention on the Iran nuclear accord.\n\nHe framed his appeal to preserve the deal with the promise of a \"bigger, better\" one.\n\nIn other words, build on the existing agreement to address its flaws, rather than scrap it and start fresh.\n\nWhether or not this is possible is an open question.\n\nBut the suggestion was enough to intrigue Mr Trump.\n\nHis tone changed, moving from a blistering harangue of the deal before the meeting to something more considered - although still noncommittal - afterwards.\n\nAnd that shows the influence of personal engagement with the president, from someone who - like Mr Macron - knows how to talk to him.\n\nWhat was Iran's response?\n\nOn Monday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani threatened \"severe consequences\" if the US withdrew from the deal.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif: \"You cannot stop the process or not engage just because of a fear of failure\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Zarif said just hours before the Trump-Macron summit that a probable response would be to restart the enrichment of uranium - a key bomb-making ingredient.\n\n\"You cannot stop the process or not engage just because of a fear of failure. But at least you need to have some hope of success, some prospect for success, in order for this process to start,\" the Iranian foreign minister was quoted as saying by Reuters.\n\n\"And I do not believe that, under the present circumstances, with the present tone, and language and approach of the current administration in Washington, you would have much prospect.\"\n\nIran maintains its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful civilian purposes.\n\nWhat are Trump's objections to the 2015 accord?\n\nThe US president has long complained that the accord - signed by the US, Iran, Europe, Russia, China and Germany - does nothing to halt Iran's support for militant groups in the region such as Hezbollah.\n\nMr Trump is also demanding that signatories to the pact agree permanent restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment.\n\nUnder the current deal they are set to expire in 2025.\n\nWhat about other issues discussed in Washington?\n\nMr Macron, on a three-day visit to the US, is the first foreign leader to be treated to a state visit during the Trump presidency.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The White House State Dinner is the first of Donald Trump's presidency\n\nPresident Macron and his wife, Brigitte, attended a state dinner in their honour at the White House on Tuesday.\n\nGuests included former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Apple chief executive Tim Cook.\n\n\"May our friendship grow even deeper, may our kinship grow even stronger, and may our sacred liberty never die,\" Mr Trump said in his toast.\n\nIn response, Mr Macron spoke of \"how deep, how strong, and how intense the relationship is between our two countries\".\n\n\"I got to know you, you got to know me.

The joint military response by the US, UK and France followed a war of words with Russia, Syria's main military ally.\n\nThe delay in the OPCW visit encouraged the proliferation of rival theories and accusations ricocheted between the various capitals and across the internet, BBC Arab Affairs editor Sebastian Usher says.\n\nWhat happened on Saturday?\n\nIn a press release, the OPCW said its team had visited one of the two sites reportedly bombed in Douma on 7 April.\n\nThe unspecified samples will be sent to the OPCW Laboratory in Rijswijk, a suburb of The Hague, and then analysed by designated labs, the agency said.\n\nOther information and \"materials\" have also been collected by the inspectors, it said.\n\nAn ITV News correspondent recorded the return of the OPCW convoy to Damascus.\n\nThe nine-strong team had been waiting for a week in the Syrian capital for clearance to visit the town.\n\nThey had been due to enter the town on Wednesday but the visit was delayed after a UN risk assessment team came under fire while checking the sites on Tuesday.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The OPCW at The Hague has shown the kind of bullet-proof vests and helmets used by its staff on missions\n\nWestern officials fear that evidence of the alleged double chemical attack may have been tampered with.\n\nHowever, important traces of toxic chemicals would probably still be present in the environment and in the remains of victims, Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, told AFP news agency.\n\n\"Nerve agents like sarin can be present in the environment for many weeks after use and particularly if you look near the site where a weapon has exploded,\" he said.\n\n\"Autopsy samples, if available, will provide invaluable evidence and nerve agents can be found in many organs.\"\n\nWhy has it taken so long?\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Journalists have been visiting a warren of tunnels dug in Douma to avoid air strikes\n\nDouma was constantly under attack during the recent Russian-backed Syrian offensive to drive rebels out of areas near Damascus and is still littered with the debris of war, making any inspection potentially hazardous.\n\nThe rebels withdrew under a deal with the Russian military just after 7 April.\n\nWhile there is suspicion that efforts may have been made to remove forensic evidence of chemical weapons, foreign journalists have already visited the town.\n\nIn a statement, the Russian foreign ministry accused the OPCW of itself taking too long to inspect the suspected attack sites.\n\nWhat happened on 7 April?\n\nOn the day of the suspected chemical attack, Douma was still under the control of the Jaish al-Islam group, the last rebel bastion in the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Unverified video shows children being treated after alleged gas attack\n\nThousands of people were sheltering in basements from government bombardment, when two bombs filled with chemicals were allegedly dropped several hours apart on two separate locations.\n\nThe US, UK and France say that, based on open-source information and their own intelligence, they are confident chlorine and possibly a nerve agent were used.\n\nThe Syrian government and Russia deny chemical weapons were used and say evidence was fabricated.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media\n\nWhile the Syrian government denies having ever used chemical weapons, experts from the UN and the OPCW have ascribed four chemical attacks to the government during the civil war.\n\nThese include an attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun just over a year ago that involved the nerve agent Sarin.

He later announced he was leaving the parliamentary group.\n\nThe main aim of the law is to cut the length of asylum applications and make the deportation system more efficient for those rejected. Refugees given asylum will be given greater help with integration and learning French.\n\nWhat's controversial about it?\n\nOne of the most significant changes is that failed asylum seekers awaiting deportation can be held for up to 90 days, double the existing period of 45 days. The government had initially aimed for a 135-day period.\n\nOpponents complained in parliament that migrants were being treated like criminals. Children can also be kept in detention with their families, although officials agreed to set up a working group to look into the issue. In 2017, 275 minors were being held in administrative detention centres. Far-left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon condemned the practice as \"barbaric\".\n\nThe deadlines for filing asylum applications or appealing against a rejection have also raised concerns. Claimants will have 90 days to file an application, down from 120 days, and two weeks to appeal against rejection.\n\nHuman Rights Watch says shortening asylum application deadlines could negatively impact the \"most vulnerable asylum seekers, who would be the ones most likely to miss the deadline\".\n\n\"Under the guise of providing a more effective asylum system, the bill includes a series of measures that would diminish access to protection,\" the group's France director B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Jeannerod said in a statement.\n\nLeft-wing parties were deeply opposed to the changes and the right-wing Republicans joined them. The far-right National Front backed some of the measures.\n\nThe bill will now be debated in the upper house, the Senate, in June.\n\nA note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.","5":"Image copyright EPA Image caption The farmhouse where the diplomats are meeting is that of ex-UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld\n\nIn a rare meeting outside New York, the UN Security Council is holding talks at a remote farmhouse in southern Sweden.\n\nThe informal session, which is held annually, is expected to focus on the Syrian conflict and on overcoming members' deep divisions on the subject.\n\nThe Swedish hosts say they hope to inject new momentum to the process.\n\nThe annual brainstorming session which sees the gathering of 15 ambassadors and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is normally held in upstate New York.\n\nThey have been invited to the talks taking place in Back\u00e5kra by Sweden, a non-permanent member of the body.\n\nThe summer house where they have congregated was that of former UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, who was the UN's second secretary-general and died in a plane crash in Africa in 1961.\n\nThe southern wing serves as the summer residence for the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Literature Prize.\n\nSweden's deputy UN ambassador Carl Skau said the idea was \"to recreate dialogue\" and \"relaunch momentum\" with \"humility and patience\", a week after the air strikes by France, the UK and the US against Syria in retaliation for an alleged chemical attack in Douma.\n\n\"It's important for the council's credibility,\" Mr Skau told reporters in New York.\n\nThe air strikes, carried out without a Security Council resolution, have led to fierce tensions between Russia, a permanent member and ally of Syria, and the US, France, the UK and China.\n\nBut on Friday, Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom warned against nurturing \"excessive hopes that the entire [Syrian] issue will be resolved\" at the meeting.\n\n\"Above all, we need to have time to talk about the long-term role of the Security Council and the United Nations in the Syrian conflict,\" she said.","6":"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Austria plans to allow authorities to seize cash as well as mobile phones from asylum seekers\n\nAustria's government surged to power late last year with a promise to stop illegal migration and crack down on refugees, and its latest move is to target their phones.\n\nAsylum seekers will be forced to hand over their mobiles so the authorities can check their identities and where they have come from, the cabinet has agreed.\n\nIf an applicant is found to have previously entered another EU country where the \"Dublin regulation\" is in force, they could be sent back there. Under the Dublin rule, people typically have to seek asylum in the first EU state they reach.\n\nIn 2015, at the height of Europe's migrant crisis, over 90,000 people applied for asylum in Austria, more than 1% of the country's population.\n\nInitially the refugees were welcomed, but the mood in the country quickly changed.\n\nSupport for the far-right, anti-immigrant Freedom Party - then in opposition - grew, and Austria's centre-right conservative People's Party, led by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz also campaigned strongly against migration.\n\nThese days, since measures were introduced to try to close off the Balkan route, the number of migrants reaching Austria has dropped significantly.\n\nIn the first three months of this year, 3,992 people claimed asylum in Austria, compared with 14,400 in the same period in 2016.\n\nBut the government is continuing with its hard line.\n\nIt wants to end what Interior Minister Herbert Kickl, of the Freedom Party, calls \"abuse\" of the asylum system.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Sebastian Kurz, from the centre-right conservative People's Party, campaigned against migration\n\nThe bill does not just target mobile phones.

The money will be used to pay for the upkeep of migrants as they wait for their asylum claims to be processed.\n\nAustria is not alone. Denmark, Germany and Switzerland have also permitted the confiscation of valuables belonging to refugees to pay for their stay. In Denmark, some reports suggest the authorities have not received large amounts of money from the policy.\n\n\"We have very deliberately set ourselves the goal of fighting against illegal migration but also against the misuse of asylum,\" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said at a news conference after the weekly cabinet meeting.\n\n'Disproportionate interference'\n\nThe bill, which must now be passed by parliament, would also force hospitals to tell the government when asylum seekers will be discharged, to ensure effective deportations.\n\nAnd the measures mean that refugees will only be able to apply for Austrian citizenship after 10 years, as opposed to six years which is currently the case.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Human rights groups have criticised the Austrian government's plans (file photo)\n\nDeportations of asylum applicants convicted of crimes will also be speeded up.\n\nOpposition parties and human rights groups have condemned the plans.\n\nAmnesty International said the plans to seize phones was \"a completely disproportionate interference in people's private affairs\", and that displaced people were being lumped together as cheats or a security risk.\n\nIt said the only thing the bill achieved was to create more \"uncertainty and mistrust among the population\".\n\nA note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.

The newspaper cited Kurdish sources as saying he was in a prison run by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia, which dominates the SDF.\n\nZammar moved from Syria to Germany in 1971. By the late 1990s, he was a prominent Islamist in the German city of Hamburg.\n\nHe is reported to have encouraged the lead 9\/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta and other members of the \"Hamburg cell\" to participate in violent jihad, and convinced them to go to Afghanistan to attend an al-Qaeda training camp, according to the 9\/11 Commission Report. There is no indication however that Zammar was aware of the plot to attack the US.\n\nThe German authorities investigated Zammar after 9\/11 on suspicion that he had \"supported a terrorist organisation\", but he was released and left the country.\n\nIn December 2001, he was seized in Morocco and transferred to Syria, apparently as part of the US Central Intelligence Agency's so-called \"extraordinary rendition\" programme.\n\nHe handed over to Syrian intelligence agents, who allegedly tortured him in detention. The agents are reported to have allowed their US and German counterparts to provide a list of questions to ask him and passed on the answers.\n\nIn 2007, a Syrian court sentenced Zammar to 12 years in prison for four offences, including membership of the outlawed Syrian Muslim Brotherhood organisation.\n\nSix years later, after Syria had descended into civil war, he was released as part of a prisoner exchange between the Syrian government and the hardline Islamist rebel group, Ahrar al-Sham.\n\nIt is not clear what happened to Zammar afterwards, but in early 2014 he was pictured attending a meeting between IS militants and Syrian tribal leaders.\n\nOne unconfirmed report from late 2014 said he was sent to Egypt by IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to persuade a jihadist group operating in the Sinai peninsula to swear allegiance to Baghdadi.","9":"Image copyright AFP\/Getty Image caption The fate of the African migrants has become hugely contentious\n\nIsrael has scrapped a plan to forcibly deport tens of thousands of illegal African migrants.\n\nIn a written response to the country's Supreme Court, the government said forced removal of the migrants \"is no longer on the agenda\".\n\nHowever, Israel's immigration authorities are still seeking ways to deport migrants voluntarily, it said.\n\nThe fate of Israel's roughly 30,000 illegal African migrants has become a hugely contentious issue.\n\nThe supreme court previously suspended a plan to expel the migrants - mostly from Eritrea and Sudan - unless they voluntarily accepted a cash lump sum and a plane ticket out of the country.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then cancelled a UN deal to resettle the migrants in Western nations.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has drawn condemnation at home and abroad over the issue\n\nUnder the deal, Israel would give \"temporary residence\" to a migrant in Israel for each migrant resettled abroad.\n\nOn Monday, 18 Democratic members of the US House of Representatives reportedly wrote to Mr Netanyahu saying they were \"dismayed\" and \"disappointed\" that he had dropped the UN proposal, saying it left the migrants \"in limbo, with no clear next step\".\n\nWhere are the migrants from?\n\nMost of the African migrants in Israel are from Eritrea - a one-party state whose leaders have been accused of crimes against humanity by a UN inquiry - and war-torn Sudan.\n\nThey say they fled danger at home and that it is not safe to return to another African country, but Israel considers the majority of African asylum seekers to be economic migrants.\n\nMost of them entered from Egypt several years ago, before a new fence was built along the desert border.

Reading the tweets of vitriol lobbed by some of Trump's fiercest social media allies was an alarming development.\n\nTo many, this act of military aggression was more than a broken campaign promise, it was a betrayal. While I don't share the sentiment, personally, I recognise the explosive element it can introduce to the fault lines in Trump's base.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump voters grade president's first year\n\nTrump, perhaps more than any modern Republican president, requires a nearly united political base of support in order achieve his political objectives in DC and abroad.\n\nWhen that ferocity is dulled, as it has been in the wake of the recent Syria air strikes, Trump's political fortunes get dicey. When some high profile conservatives start taking stances of opposition against Trump's re-election, over brief coalition-led air strikes, it's time to appreciate the ramifications.\n\nSuch a tempestuous response to a limited and, for Trump at least, fairly telegraphed military manoeuvre, speaks volumes as to the political danger it exposes.\n\nAs a seasoned political operative, I tend to view such overreactions in a dubious light. However, I am witnessing a political phenomenon unveiling itself that defies traditional interpretation.\n\nRead more on Trump and the Syria civil war\n\nTaking for granted that these volatile voters will surely come home again is a fool's errand. There is a vital component of Trump's base made up of disaffected liberal activists who felt abused and ignored by the establishment wing of the Democratic party. They have formed an uneasy alliance with libertarians who thought they had finally found a serious political foothold with the Trump presidency.\n\nThis \"coalition of the wary\", as I call them, are not the stuff upon which political foundations are built. The outcry at the air strikes from these polemic forces of the Trump base came as fast as they came furious.\n\nMy own Twitter feed and email account were instantly overwhelmed with sentiments of shocked defiance; coinciding with a nearly codified belief that the chemical attacks that served as an impetus to the strikes were a \"false flag\" to ensure US did not withdraw from Syria.\n\nTrump must now carefully take stock of these reactions from his base and weigh them as evidence as to conveying the message of his foreign diplomacy going forward. This will be his greatest challenge.\n\nDazzling diplomacy\n\nThe president is notorious for loathing a rigid and static foreign policy. Explaining his motivations and ultimate diplomatic goals to his own secretary of state and UN ambassador has proven problematic enough - the thought of doing so to an intervention-weary political base may prove too much.\n\nMyself, I see the brilliance in his dazzling array of diplomatic moves since taking office. Often they directly belie a candidate pledge, or two, but they are extremely effective.\n\nA few months ago, many pundits in the media were raising the threat of a nuclear conflict with North Korea. Now, it seems the more relevant question is whether or not Trump can defy historical odds and unify the Koreas. Talk about a diplomatic turnaround.\n\nTrump has also finessed a few favourable trade concessions from a famously recalcitrant Chinese government. No president in US history came into office with more experience than Trump has with China, and it shows.\n\nVladimir Putin can scarcely contain his astonishment at Trump's diplomatic strides. Two years ago, Russia was dangling a peace process in the Middle East, due to a vacuum of US leadership in the region.\n\nToday, they are scratching their heads as Trump managed to finally commence a long-promised move of the US embassy to Jerusalem. Suddenly the United Nations is far more concerned with US funding commitments and not getting evicted from their prime New York headquarters, than they are in being a roadblock to Trump's agenda.\n\nCandidate Trump campaigned on rebuilding our military, and not using it to engage in nation-building in a war-torn Middle East. It was an effective message.\n\nMassive military spending is now underway, and with it, a fluid and effective foreign policy is being wielded by President Trump; an American president more at the helm of his own global diplomacy than any since FDR.\n\nTrump has extracted an inordinate return for his surgically brief military deployments and operations. His willingness to chide allies in the region, like Jordan and Saudi Arabia, to invest more in their own security, has borne fruit at a stunning rate.\n\nRussia is now trapped, forced to either financially dump valuable resources into Syria, and worse, weigh the risk of having their precious Iranian deal scrapped. That's a no-win situation for Putin.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The air strikes sparked protests in New York\n\nAll of this for a hundred missiles wiping out an empty airfield and three buildings in Syria? Impressive. The fact that John Bolton now occupies an office a few feet from Trump can't do anything to improve Mr Putin's mood either.\n\nWhile all of this success in a global sense bodes well for Trump, it's only a silver lining to the angst reverberating through the ranks of his base.\n\nIf he needs reminding of how the base reacted to military force, he need only check his vaunted Twitter account. The evidence is all right there.\n\nYou can build a bigger and better military, Mr President, but there is a large cross-section of your base that don't want you to use it.\n\nAnd so, the old axiom proves true: with friends like these, who needs enemies?\n\nAdam Gingrich, a former campaign operative for the Trump Campaign in Pennsylvania, is currently the President of the MAGA Coalition, Inc - A Pro-Trump PAC","11":"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Memphis removes Confederate statues\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Tennessee are withholding funds from the city of Memphis after it used a legal loophole to remove two Confederate monuments.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House pulled money for the city's bicentennial plans next year in a last-minute amendment attached to a government spending bill.\n\nThe statues depicted the leader of the US rebellion and a slave-trader who became the first Ku Klux Klan leader.\n\nConfederate statues have become a major flashpoint in a national race debate.\n\nRepublican Andy Holt said on the House floor: \"Today is a demonstration that bad actions have bad consequences, and my only regret about this is it's not in the tune of millions of dollars.\"\n\nHe likened the removal of Confederate statues to the actions of the Islamic State (IS), which appeared to refer to the terror group's destruction of ancient sites like Palmyra in Syria.\n\nThe grant that was withheld, which would have provided $250,000 (\u00a3175,000) for the city's bicentennial celebration, was dropped from a $37.5m government spending bill on Tuesday by House legislators.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Bedford was a slave trader and leader of the Ku Klux Klan white supremacist group\n\nDemocrats who represent the majority-black city called the move \"racist\".\n\n\"You can boo all you want but let's call it for what it is,\" Memphis lawmaker Antonio Parkinson told Republicans at the raucous hearing where the bill passed by a vote of 87-5.\n\n\"This is one of the most vile, racist acts I've seen happen in the legislature,\" he later told the Washington Post.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Can removing Confederate statues help heal a nation?\n\nDemocrats noted the last-minute amendment to the bill came a week after the city held official commemorations to black civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, who was assassinated there 50 years ago.\n\nMemphis last year sold two parks containing the memorials to a non-profit organisation for below-market price, which allowed the city to skirt a historic preservation law requiring state approval to remove monuments on public lands.\n\nThe Tennessee Heritage Protection Act requires a state historical commission to issue a waiver for any alterations to monuments in public parks.\n\nBut the city sold the parks to a private entity without approval and had them immediately removed.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why do Confederate statues divide the United States?\n\nAt least two online fundraisers have been set up to replace the lost bicentennial budget.\n\nOne drive, which has been sponsored by Memphis mayor Jim Strickland, topped nearly $50,000 on Thursday.\n\nWhy were these statues controversial?\n\nOne of the Memphis statues was dedicated to Jefferson Davis, the president of pro-slavery Confederacy in the US Civil War of 1861-65.\n\nThe second statue honoured Nathan Bedford Forrest, a slave trader, Confederate general and a leader in the Ku Klux Klan white supremacist group.\n\nThe city's decision to remove the monuments came amid a national wave of US municipalities moving to tear down Confederate iconography from public spaces.\n\nCritics say the controversial statues honour traitors and racists while supporters argue they preserve American history.","12":"Miles Jupp is joined by Michael Deacon, Kerry Godliman, Jeremy Hardy and Felicity Ward for a satirical review of the week's news.\n\nTonight the panel discuss the parliamentary debate over military action in Syria, the treatment of the Windrush Generation and the best way to get out of a binding gym contract in Belgium.\n\nWritten by James Kettle, Jenny Laville and Benjamin Partridge with additional material by Laura Major, Mike Shephard and Michael Stranney.\n\nProduced by Joe Nunnery\n\nA BBC Studios Production.","13":"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The ups and downs of Trump and Macron\n\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron is in Washington this week, the first foreign leader to make a state visit under Donald Trump. The two men - both seen as outsiders before their presidential campaigns - have developed an unlikely personal rapport, but what's behind the connection, and what does it mean for French interests and influence?\n\nEmmanuel Macron's relationships have raised eyebrows more than once.\n\nWeeks after taking office, he passed over France's key allies and chose the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, as his first foreign guest - a man he's due to visit in Moscow next month, despite recently ordering airstrikes against Russia's Syrian ally.\n\nHis ecumenical approach has sometimes caused diplomatic tiffs, most recently with Ankara, incensed by the suggestion that it might like France to mediate between Turkey and the Kurds.\n\nBut nothing has drawn the same attention as his \"bromance\" with Donald Trump.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The US president attended France's Bastille Day celebrations in 2017\n\nThere is the unlikely age difference between the two men, their difference in political vision and values, in their style and personality, their backgrounds, their interests, their use of the media.\n\nAnd yet, the Elys\u00e9e describes their relationship as \"very close\", and the two men really do, by all accounts, speak often and frankly by telephone, and seem to have a genuine rapport.\n\nThis rapport has pushed France ahead of Germany and the UK, to become America's primary European contact.\n\nBritain's retreat from Europe and Germany's trade and immigration policies helped open the way for Mr Macron, and it has not escaped notice here that it's he, and not Mrs May or Mrs Merkel, who is making the first state visit of the Trump presidency, when he will be a guest at a formal banquet and address the Congress.\n\nAnd there are personal reasons for the new Franco-American bond.\n\nBoth Mr Macron and Mr Trump were seen as shaking up the political systems in their countries; both are - in their own ways - outspoken; and both like to project an image of strength. It doesn't hurt either, say some on the American side, that Mr Macron is male, and seen as handsome.\n\nBut France may also have an easier time adjusting to the disruptive Trump presidency precisely because it didn't have the kind of close, shared vision that both Germany and the UK have had with recent American presidents.\n\nFrance is pragmatic in its approach to Washington - an alliance based on mutual interests rather than a shared moral vision of the world.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump's handshakes with world leaders have been closely watched\n\nThose mutual interests are still dominated by security and counter-terrorism. France needs the US for its international fight against terrorism, and as analysts here will tell you, Paris has come to be seen as Washington's best bet for military support, in the wake of British caution following the Iraq War.\n\nMr Trump's approach to security has sometimes helped President Macron's own agenda in Europe. The American leader has been robust in asking EU states to take a greater role in their own security, and raise their defence spending to 2% of GDP.\n\nMr Macron, who has promised France will meet that target by 2025, is keen for Europe to have more autonomy in security and defence matters, and is pushing his proposal of a European Intervention Initiative, with the common resources and strategic goals that would allow it to carry out its own missions, as France does now.\n\nBut in a country where too close a proximity to the US can be politically dangerous for a president, Mr Macron will need to have something more to have show for it.\n\nImage copyright AFP\/Getty Image caption Mr Macron's close relationship with Mr Trump makes France America's primary European contact\n\nHe recently claimed to have convinced his American counterpart to stay engaged in Syria, but that was quickly denied by the White House. And so far, despite raising expectations, there's little evidence of the French leader's influence over President Trump on key issues like climate change, the Iran nuclear deal, or the status of Jerusalem.\n\nThis visit will be a chance to discuss those policy differences with the US, with France hoping to agree \"a document of recommendations\" with Washington ahead of Mr Trump's planned withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement next month.\n\nPresident Macron will also talk to Donald Trump about his planned tariffs on EU steel and aluminium, the conflict in Syria, and Washington's controversial decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n\nBut, even without any concrete influence over these issues, there's intrinsic value for Mr Macron in his relationship with Donald Trump.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Toned-down Trump: What happened to the tough talk on Paris?\n\nMr Macron began his presidency with a commitment to restore French status abroad and a sense of its mission in the world. Lofty aims, which he believes are key to France regaining a sense of national identity and optimism.\n\nHis close relationship to Donald Trump, even without much policy influence, raises France's global profile and boosts its influence and leverage elsewhere.\n\nEmmanuel Macron's diplomatic trademark is strong personal connections combined with robust policy differences - a delicate juggling act, on occasion.\n\nPresident Trump's relationships can be unpredictable - analysts point out that Macron has been careful not to criticise him personally. And if Mr Trump's decisions directly harm French interests, Emmanuel Macron could find himself on the receiving end of far more damaging criticism - from French voters.\n\nIn which case, the relationship that boosts the French president's status abroad could end up scuppering it at home.","14":"Video\n\nA group of peers and priests from the UK have been criticised after they met with Syrian MPs, religious leaders and citizens.\n\nBaroness Cox, who was part of the delegation, said \"there's terror on both sides\" when she was asked on the Today programme why she did not raise the issue of alleged human rights abuses with the Grand Mufti, Syria's top Muslim cleric, when she met him.","15":"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Syrian refugees arrive on the Isle of Bute\n\nThe UK has accepted more than 10,000 Syrian refugees in the past two and a half years - but analysis by the BBC shows large disparities in the numbers going to different parts of the country.\n\nScotland has taken four times as many Syrian refugees as Greater London, while Northern Ireland has taken over 300 more than the whole of the east of England.\n\nRelative to their populations, northern England has taken over twice as many Syrian refugees as the South.\n\nOverall, almost a third of local authorities are yet to take any Syrian refugees.\n\nThe BBC analysis looks at the Home Office's breakdown of local authority intake of Syrian refugees and weighs this against the population size.\n\nIt was the pictures of three-year-old Alan Kurdi, his tiny body washed up on a Turkish tourist beach in September 2015, that changed the politics of Syrian refugees.\n\nWithin days of the distressing photographs appearing in Britain's newspapers, Prime Minister David Cameron announced the UK would take up to 20,000 people who had fled the war in Syria and were now at camps in Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, Egypt and Jordan.\n\n\"It is absolutely right that Britain should fulfil its moral responsibility to help those refugees,\" Mr Cameron told the House of Commons, adding that Britain would \"continue to show the world that this is a country of extraordinary compassion always standing up for our values and helping those in need\".\n\nGiven that, why is it that some parts of the UK have taken more Syrian refugees than others? Why, for example, has only one refugee found a home in the local authorities of Northamptonshire while 226 have ended up in Nottinghamshire?\n\nCouncils are under no obligation to accept Syrian refugees. If they do offer to take some, in the first year all their resettlement costs are covered by central government. After that, the money tapers off - \u00a35,000 in the second year and down to \u00a31,000 in year five.\n\nThe government set up the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (SVPRS) promising \"equitable distribution\", but fairness in these matters is hard to define.\n\nTop five intake of Syrian refugees relative to population:\n\nClackmannanshire, Scotland\n\nGateshead, England\n\nArgyll and Bute, Scotland\n\nHartlepool, England\n\nPendle, England\n\nBottom five intake of Syrian refugees relative to population:\n\nManchester, England\n\nCroydon, England\n\nEnfield, England\n\nBromley, England\n\nWigan, England\n\nThe statistics suggest that two of the poorest regions in England, Yorkshire and the North East, have taken three times as many refugees relative to the population as the two wealthiest regions, London and the South East.\n\nAreas not often associated as migration \"hotspots\" such as Scotland's Clackmannanshire and Comhairle Nan Eilean Siar - the Western Isles - have taken some of the highest numbers of refugees - over nine per 10,000 of their population.\n\nBut in areas with huge demand for local authority housing, those in the queue for a council house are more likely to resent accommodation being given to new arrivals ahead of local people. Is it fair to send large numbers of refugees to these places?\n\nAlthough there is more money to support Syrian refugees than asylum seekers generally, the costs of housing someone in the South East of England are still greater than the North East. Is it reasonable to expect places with sky-high rents potentially to spend more on refugees where there are no regional adjustments in funding?\n\nThe Local Government Association says that councils have had \"an excellent track-record\" in welcoming refugees and ensuring they have suitable support based on their experiences.\n\n\"Clear links need to be made across all the programmes that resettle asylum seekers and refugee families and children to make sure there is enough funding and capacity for all new arrivals to build new lives in their new communities.\"\n\nAsylum seekers\n\nThe number of Syrian refugees taken in by local authorities should not be looked at in isolation. Over the years some parts of the UK have taken many more asylum seekers than others.\n\nThis raises the question of whether they should be asked to carry the additional responsibility for Syrian refugees.\n\nAt the end of last year, there were just over 40,000 asylum seekers located across the UK. Asylum seekers are from around the world and must reach the UK before claiming asylum, unlike those on the SVPRS.\n\nOnce you have claimed asylum, the Home Office will determine whether you qualify for refugee status. Until then, asylum seekers are dispersed across the UK and offered some financial support.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Asylum seekers must physically reach the UK before they can apply for refugee status\n\nLocal authorities have less involvement in housing asylum seekers as this is contracted to the private sector, but they must volunteer to house them in their area and have a say in implementation.\n\nCombining the Syrian refugee scheme and asylum seekers statistics shows that while places such as Liverpool and Newcastle have accepted more than 15 people per 10,000 people, 120 local authorities have accommodated less than one for every 10,000 in the local population.\n\nWhile London has accommodated relatively few Syrian refugees (less than one per 10,000 population), it has accepted 10 times that number of asylum seekers with an overall impact of six per 10,000 people.\n\nSimilarly, the local authorities that make up Greater Manchester have taken just 15 Syrian refugees (in Trafford and Tameside), but act as one of the largest suppliers of support for refugees and asylum seekers - 25 per 10,000 population.\n\nIt appears that Scotland has generally embraced its claim to be a \"sanctuary\" for those fleeing conflict. Glasgow has taken 63 refugees and asylum seekers per 10,000 in the city - the highest level in any local authority.\n\nConcerns over unequal dispersal are not new. Last year, a Home Affairs Select Committee report said: \"The policy of dispersal was introduced to deliver an equitable distribution of asylum seekers across the UK. It has failed to achieve this.\n\n\"Pressure on the South East of England may have been alleviated, but it has been replaced by the clustering of asylum seekers in some of the most deprived parts of the country.\"\n\nForty-six English local authorities have given a home to none at all, and 20 of those councils are in East Anglia and the Fens.\n\nTop five intake of Syrian refugees and asylum seekers relative to population:\n\nGlasgow, Scotland\n\nRochdale, England\n\nBarking and Dagenham, England\n\nSwansea, Wales\n\nMiddlesbrough, England\n\nBottom five intake of Syrian refugees and asylum seekers relative to population:\n\nHuntingdonshire, England\n\nChelmsford, England\n\nMaidstone, England\n\nSouth Cambridgeshire, England\n\nKings Lynn and West Norfolk, England\n\nA research study for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees found that UK councils' decision to accept people under the SVPRS was based on a number of considerations:\n\nthe vulnerability of the refugees\n\nthe availability of suitable housing, schools and NHS services\n\nthe risks in relation to safety and community cohesion\n\nA Home Office official said: \"We are grateful for the ongoing support from the over 270 local authorities across the UK who are helping to resettle refugees fleeing the brutal conflict in Syria.\n\n\"Local authority participation in the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme is voluntary and we work closely with councils across the country to ensure that no area is asked to take more than they are able to cope with.\"\n\nThe Home Office also notes that the government is the second largest donor in humanitarian assistance and has pledged \u00a32.46bn in UK aid to Syria and the neighbouring countries, its largest ever response to a single humanitarian crisis.","16":"Madsen to serve life in prison for murdering Swedish journalist Kim Wall on his submarine.\n\nAlso, Indian guru Asaram Bapu sentenced to life for raping girl, international conference raises pledges of humanitarian aid for Syria, we profile the Incels - a sinister and misogynistic online community, and why Japan is angry about dessert due to be served at Korean summit.","17":"Investigators gather samples following the suspected poison gas attack in Syria, which killed dozens of civilians.
