USA TODAY\n\nUS President Donald Trump addresses the nation on the situation in Syria April 13, 2018 at the White House in Washington, DC. Trump said strikes on Syria are under way. (Photo: MANDEL NGAN, AFP\/Getty Images)\n\nFull text of President Trump's remarks on the attack on Syria:\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans, a short time ago, I ordered the United States Armed Forces to launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapons capabilities of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A combined operation with the armed forces of France and the United Kingdom is now underway. We thank them both.\n\nTonight, I want to speak with you about why we have taken this action.\n\nOne year ago, Assad launched a savage chemical weapons attack against his own innocent people. The United States responded with 58 missile strikes that destroyed 20 percent of the Syrian Air Force.\n\nLast Saturday, the Assad regime again deployed chemical weapons to slaughter innocent civilians -- this time, in the town of Douma, near the Syrian capital of Damascus. This massacre was a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use by that very terrible regime.\n\nThe evil and the despicable attack left mothers and fathers, infants and children, thrashing in pain and gasping for air. These are not the actions of a man; they are crimes of a monster instead.\n\nFollowing the horrors of World War I a century ago, civilized nations joined together to ban chemical warfare. Chemical weapons are uniquely dangerous not only because they inflict gruesome suffering, but because even small amounts can unleash widespread devastation.\n\nThe purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons. Establishing this deterrent is a vital national security interest of the United States. The combined American, British, and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power -- military, economic, and diplomatic. We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.\n\nI also have a message tonight for the two governments most responsible for supporting, equipping, and financing the criminal Assad regime.\n\nTo Iran, and to Russia, I ask: What kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women, and children?\n\nThe nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep. No nation can succeed in the long run by promoting rogue states, brutal tyrants, and murderous dictators.\n\nIn 2013, President Putin and his government promised the world that they would guarantee the elimination of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. Assad\u2019s recent attack -- and today\u2019s response -- are the direct result of Russia\u2019s failure to keep that promise.\n\nRussia must decide if it will continue down this dark path, or if it will join with civilized nations as a force for stability and peace. Hopefully, someday we\u2019ll get along with Russia, and maybe even Iran -- but maybe not.\n\nI will say this: The United States has a lot to offer, with the greatest and most powerful economy in the history of the world.\n\nIn Syria, the United States -- with but a small force being used to eliminate what is left of ISIS -- is doing what is necessary to protect the American people. Over the last year, nearly 100 percent of the territory once controlled by the so-called ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been liberated and eliminated.\n\nThe United States has also rebuilt our friendships across the Middle East. We have asked our partners to take greater responsibility for securing their home region, including contributing large amounts of money for the resources, equipment, and all of the anti-ISIS effort. Increased engagement from our friends, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, and others can ensure that Iran does not profit from the eradication of ISIS.\n\nAmerica does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria under no circumstances. As other nations step up their contributions, we look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home. And great warriors they are.\n\nLooking around our very troubled world, Americans have no illusions. We cannot purge the world of evil, or act everywhere there is tyranny.\n\nNo amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East. It\u2019s a troubled place. We will try to make it better, but it is a troubled place. The United States will be a partner and a friend, but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people.\n\nIn the last century, we looked straight into the darkest places of the human soul. We saw the anguish that can be unleashed and the evil that can take hold. By the end of the World War I, more than one million people had been killed or injured by chemical weapons. We never want to see that ghastly specter return.\n\nSo today, the nations of Britain, France, and the United States of America have marshaled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality.\n\nTonight, I ask all Americans to say a prayer for our noble warriors and our allies as they carry out their missions.\n\nWe pray that God will bring comfort to those suffering in Syria. We pray that God will guide the whole region toward a future of dignity and of peace.\n\nAnd we pray that God will continue to watch over and bless the United States of America.\n\nThank you, and goodnight. Thank you.\n\nRead or Share this story: https:\/\/usat.ly\/2GWvUMc","2":"CLOSE U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley says new sanctions will be imposed on Russia.

The government\u2019s growth-rate forecast for 2018 is 2% of gross domestic product, the best in seven years, and the country\u2019s budget deficit has stayed within the European Union\u2019s established parameters for the first time in a decade.\n\nThis spring, Macron\u2019s government initiated changes to tax retirees more and employees less, cut jobs in some hospitals, reorganize the justice system and apply a new university admissions system, all of which prompted protests.\n\nMeanwhile, train workers have launched on-and-off strikes over a railway labor-reform plan, disrupting traffic nationwide.\n\nOn Saturday, 63 people were arrested and nine police officers injured during protests in the cities of Nantes and Montpellier. Other marches across France were largely peaceful.\n\nLast week, Macron promised on national television that he would push ahead with railway labor reforms and other divisive plans \u2014 despite criticism \u2014 \u201cbecause the world around us is speeding up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: https:\/\/usat.ly\/2H0bEct","3":"This photo, released by the Syrian official news agency SANA, shows smoke, rising after U.S.-led airstrikes targeting different parts of the Syrian capital Damascus.

(Photo: Susan Walsh, AP)\n\nThe U.S. airstrike on Syria Friday night is creating a tense tug-of-war in the already strained relations with Russia, which has sent its warships into the Mediterranean to keep a close eye on their American naval adversaries.\n\nRussian ambassador Anatoly Antonov warned late Friday that the attack \"will not be left without consequences.\"\n\n\"The worst apprehensions have come true,\" Antonov said in a tweet reported by ABC News. \"Our warnings have been left unheard . . . We are being threatened.

The first came a year and one week ago, when Trump ordered a similar, smaller attack on a Syrian air base suspected of housing chemical weapons.\n\nSunday's notification followed much the same format, claiming that he president has broad authority as commander-in-chief to commit U.S. forces to protect national interests.\n\nBut his time, Trump added another legal argument: The strikes were necessary \"to deter the use and proliferation of chemical weapons, and to avert a worsening of the region's current humanitarian catastrophe.\"\n\nMore: Trump seeks to reclaim a Bush-era phrase: 'Mission Accomplished'\n\nAssociated Press: France persuaded Trump to strike in Syria, Macron says\n\nBecause it's the second strike against Syria in as many years, the action raises an additional legal complication. The War Powers Act requires the president to \"terminate any use of United States Armed Forces\" after 60 days unless Congress specifically authorizes future action.\n\nBecause the U.S. did not commit ground troops to the conflict, the White House is treating Friday's strike as a separate conflict that starts the 60-day clock over.\n\nThat's not good enough for congressional critics who say Trump should have sought approval to launch strikes.\n\n\"It's very, very clear Congress has power to declare war, and only Congress,\" said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., on CBS's Face the Nation Sunday. \"So if you are initiating war against a sovereign nation like Syria that hadn't declared war on United States, it's only Congress that can do it. President Trump is not a king. He's a president.\"\n\nThe air strikes came just hours after 88 members of Congress \u2014 72 Democrats and 16 Republicans \u2014 urged Trump to consult Congress before taking military action. \"Engaging our military in Syria when no direct threat to the United States exists and without prior congressional authorization would violate the separation of powers that is clearly delineated in the Constitution,\" they said.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said any further escalation of the conflict should require clear approval from Congress.\n\n\"The president does need to come to Congress,\u201d she said on NBC's Meet the Press. \u201cWe need to have these discussions because we don't see that Bashar al-Assad will all of a sudden become a real nice guy.\u201d\n\nBut Chris Edelson, an American University professor who studies presidential war powers, said Trump \u2014 like previous presidents \u2014 has taken advantage of congressional gridlock to enhance the war powers of the president.\n\n\"Unless Congress is going to exert itself and define some limits, it\u2019s going to be up to the administration to decide what to do,\" he said. \"The only thing limiting the administration is the administration itself.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https:\/\/usat.ly\/2qBhqq7","10":"Russia: Chemical weapons inspectors head to Syria site\n\nAssociated Press\n\nUN chief: No military solution for Syria United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Saturday there was no military solution to the Syrian conflict, stressing that the crisis could only be solved politically.

There is clear information demonstrating (Syria leader Bashar) Assad's culpability. The pictures of dead children were not fake news. They were the result of the Syrian regime's barbaric inhumanity.\"\n\nDamascus skies erupt with surface-to-air missile fire as the U.S. launches an attack on Syria targeting different parts of the Syrian capital of Damascus early on April 14, 2018.

The interceptor missiles appeared to lack guidance systems.\n\n\u201cNearly every one was launched after the last of our missiles hit their targets,\u201d Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said.\n\nThe failure highlights how ineffective Syria\u2019s military has become and the degree to which it now depends on Russia and Iran, its principal sponsors, for security, said Christopher Kozak, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nU.S., French and British forces launched 105 missiles from aircraft and ships at three chemical weapons facilities in Syria last weekend in response to a chemical weapons attack launched by the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nRussia claimed that Syrian defenses knocked down many incoming missiles, but the Pentagon said every weapon hit its intended target, dismissing the Russian comments as a disinformation campaign.\n\nSyria is equipped with a relatively sophisticated air defense system, but a lack of training, command and control and other human factors are probably responsible for the failure, analysts said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the physical capability of the air defense system,\u201d said David Deptula, a retired, three-star Air Force general. \u201cIt\u2019s about the people who are operating the system.\u201d\n\nImage of the Barzah Research and Development Center in Damascus, Syria before an airstrike by forces from the United States, Great Britain and France.

Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, director of the joint staff. \"They did not choose to engage.\"\n\nThe modern S-400 air defense system that the Russians have in Syria is principally used for defending its two major bases inside the country.\n\nTo defend its airspace, Assad's military employs the older Russian-built S-200 air defense system, a network of radar and ground-to-air missiles that was first designed in the 1960s.\n\nSyria may also have the more modern Pantsir system, which is designed to defend individual bases or facilities and doesn\u2019t have the range to cover the entire country.\n\nSyria's military has been weakened after seven years of war. Its recent successes in retaking territory is largely the result of help from Russia, which has been supplying air power, and Iran, which has deployed ground troops.\n\nBarmah Research and Development Center in Damascus, Syria. (Photo: DigitalGlobe, via USA TODAY Network)\n\nAfter the U.S. attacked a Syrian airfield last year following a similar chemical attack on its people, Assad complained that his regime couldn\u2019t defend its air space because half the country\u2019s air defense system had been destroyed by the civil war.\n\nSeveral years prior to that, the Pentagon had described Syria\u2019s air defense system as a challenge for American forces.\n\nWhen the U.S. was weighing the option of establishing a no-fly zone over Syria, Gen. Martin Dempsey, then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said Syria\u2019s air defense system was \u201chigh end.\u201d\n\n\"I'm not saying we couldn't beat that system, but it would be a greater challenge, take longer and require greater resources,\" he said in 2013.\n\nBut even a sophisticated air defense system would have had trouble defending against the type of attack conducted by the U.S.-led coalition, analysts say.\n\nThe cruise missiles fly low and emit little heat for interceptor missiles to lock on to. They can also be programmed on a flight path that makes it difficult to predict where they will appear.\n\nThe sheer number of incoming missiles also makes them hard to track and hit at the same time. \u201cTheir systems would be overwhelmed by 100 cruise missiles,\u201d said Michael Pregent, an analyst at the Hudson Institute. Each battery has several dozen missiles and reloading takes nearly an hour.\n\nThe U.S. military would typically jam enemy radar when conducting airstrikes, making it difficult for the Syrians to employ their systems.\n\n\u201cAir defenses aren\u2019t invulnerable,\u201d Deptula said. \u201cWe just proved that.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https:\/\/usat.ly\/2vzen7D","18":"A U.S. mine detector armored vehicle, leads a convoy of U.S. troops, on a road leading to the tense front line with Turkish-backed fighters, in Manbij town, north Syria, Saturday, March 31, 2018.
