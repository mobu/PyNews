The area surrounding it is largely unaffected. 14 people died in the strike, with at least seven being Iranian military men, including the head of its drone program, Col. Mehdi Dehghan.\n\nSatellite images of the T-4 base in Syria before and after an airstrike on April 9 (Screenshot\/Channel 10).\n\nThe airstrike targeted an Iranian weapons cache at the base, the TV report said. The site also housed Russian and Syrian military equipment, including air defense systems, which remained intact.\n\n\u201c[The raid] was a barrage of small explosives designed to destroy the contents of the hanger, but not damage unintended targets,\u201d Channel 10 said.\n\nThe T-4 airbase has been targeted by Israel on at least two occasions in the past, including, most recently, in February following the incursion by an explosives-laden drone into Israeli airspace. According to Israel, which admitted it carried out February\u2019s strike, the drone was launched from a command center at T-4.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Sunday said Israel\u2019s routine operations in Syria would have \u201cconsequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not believe that we are headed towards regional war, but I do believe that, unfortunately, Israel has continued its violations with international law, hoping to be able to do it with impunity because of the US support and trying to find smokescreens to hide behind,\u201d Zarif told CBS News.\n\n\u201cAnd I do not believe that the smokescreens work anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later warned the world not to heed Zarif\u2019s \u201cmoderate\u201d remarks, saying there was a \u201chuge gap\u201d between what he might tell an American TV station versus the on-the-ground entrenchment by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, which is \u201cadvancing an army against Israel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard the remarks of the Iranian foreign minister, who accuses Israel of violating international law,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cHe is the foreign minister of a country that deploys armed drones to Israel and missiles to Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also heard his moderate remarks, and there is a huge gap between his words and the actions of the Revolutionary Guards, who are advancing an army against Israel with the stated aim of destroying Israel,\u201d the prime minister continued. \u201cI\u2019m unimpressed by his remarks.\u201d","2":"WASHINGTON, DC \u2014 The Islamic State (ISIS\/ISIL) remains a \u201cpotent\u201d menace in Libya more than a year after U.S.-backed local forces pushed the group out of former stronghold Sirte, experts told a House panel.\n\nSoon after the Islamic State (IS) lost Sirte in December 2016, U.S. and Libyan officials began warning about a potential resurgence of the terrorist group, noting that the jihadists were regrouping elsewhere in Libya, namely the desert valleys and inland hills southeast of the country.\n\nIn written testimony prepared for a hearing Wednesday held by the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and Africa, Christopher Blanchard, a specialist in Middle Eastern affairs at the Congressional Research Service (CRS), acknowledged:\n\nTransnational terrorist groups and locally organized armed extremist groups, including supporters of the Islamic State organization and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), remain active in Libya. Some IS fighters appear to have regrouped in rural areas after fleeing Sirte in late 2016, and the group claimed a series of attacks on Libyan forces in 2017.\n\nRobyn Mack, a spokeswoman for U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), predicted early this year that ISIS would \u201cgive priority to the restructuring of security forces and infrastructure, and to launch strikes, which may include targets in the Libyan oil crescent.\u201d\n\nWhile testifying before U.S. lawmakers in March, Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the AFRICOM commander, described ISIS as \u201cdispersed and disorganized and likely capable of little more than localized attacks.\u201d\n\nHowever, Frederic Wehrey, a senior fellow for the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, cautioned in his written testimony prepared for the House panel hearing Wednesday that the group presents a \u201cpotent\u201d threat, telling lawmakers:\n\nThe aftermath of Sirte also raises the question of the Islamic State\u2019s potential reemergence. Based on my discussions with Libyan officials, the Islamic State has fled to the desert southwest of the city where it remains dispersed but still potent. It could easily exploit Libya\u2019s political divisions and the inability or unwillingness of Libya\u2019s armed groups to confront it. We have seen this before when Libya\u2019s opposing factions were so focused on battling one another that they ignored the growing radical presence in their midst. This is why national-level political reconciliation is so important, along with unifying and reforming the security sector.\n\nEchoing the other expert witnesses, Alice Friend, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) also testified that ISIS is still active in Libya.\n\nThe group maintains \u201ca scattered presence in the East and South, and the commander of Africa Command testified that the U.S. conducted eight strikes against ISIS targets in late 2017 and early 2018,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAlthough ISIS has suffered significant losses in its collapsing caliphate in Iraq and Syria, the group remains a serious threat outside those two countries, particularly in Yemen, Somalia, Libya, West Africa, Egypt, Bangladesh, Philippines, and Tunisia.\n\nISIS jihadists are \u201cadapting\u201d to their ongoing demise in Iraq and Syria by intensifying their activity \u201cin all\u201d other corners of the world, including Africa, Bangladesh, and Southeast Asia, Nathan Sales, the counterterrorism coordinator at the U.S. Department of State, told reporters last month.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community\u2019s Worldwide Threat Assessment unveiled in February predicted that ISIS would \u201cenhancing its global presence, championing its cause, planning international attacks, and encouraging its members and sympathizers to attack in their home countries\u201d this year.\n\n\u201cISIS\u2019s claim of having a functioning caliphate that governs populations is all but thwarted \u2026 Outside Iraq and Syria, ISIS\u2019s goal of fostering interconnectivity and resiliency among its global branches and networks probably will result in local and, in some cases, regional attack plans,\u201d it added.","3":"(UPI) \u2014 Iran\u2019s military head said Saturday that forces are preparing to \u201cannihilate\u201d Israel\u2019s Zionist regime within 25 years after recent threats between the foes.\n\nThe threat from Commander of Iran\u2019s Army Maj.

It has now been almost two weeks since the attack occurred.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, the OPCW explained that security for the sites that its fact-finding mission intended to visit was the responsibility of Russian military police. Arrangements were made for the Syrian military to escort the OPCW team to a \u201ccertain point,\u201d where the Russians would take over.\n\nThe United Nations decided to send its own security team in advance.

The photos were taken from the set of a propaganda film supported by the Syrian culture ministry that was completed and screened over a month before the chemical attack.","12":"U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron are expected to tackle controversial topics from trade to terrorism during the first state visit of the Trump administration.\n\nTrump and Macron will discuss economic, diplomatic, and global issues during the state visit, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders informed reporters on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe first lady has taken an active role in every detail and planning of the visit including the State Dinner which will be held tomorrow evening,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cWe are looking forward to a very successful state visit.\u201d\n\nA senior administration official expressed in a briefing last Friday that President Trump has been \u201ceager to host the Macrons for this special event as he remembers fondly the dinner the couples shared together in the Eiffel Tower on the eve of Bastille Day last July 2017.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday the two Presidents will meet privately in a one-on-one Oval Office meeting before holding an expanded, working, bilateral meeting with the French and U.S. delegations, according to the senior administration official.\n\nThis expanded meeting is to include U.S. officials Vice President Mike Pence, the Acting Secretary of State, Secretary of Treasury, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Commerce, White House Chief of Staff, National Security Advisor, Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and U.S. Ambassador to France Jamie McCourt.\n\nThe French delegation is expected to include their Minister of Foreign affairs, Minister of Economics and Finance, Minister of Defense, National Security Advisor, and others.\n\nPresidents Trump and Macron will hold a joint press conference on Tuesday.\n\nDuring Friday\u2019s briefing, the senior administration official indicated that Trump and Macron would travel to Arlington Cemetery for a wreath laying ceremony before the Tuesday evening State Dinner at the White House.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Macron will address a joint session of Congress. The administration official noted that the day marks the 58th anniversary of then-President of France Charles de Gaulle\u2019s 1960 address to Congress.\n\nThe senior administration official laid out three themes for the state visit. First: \u201cThe United States and France enjoy a long and enduring friendship.\u201d Second: \u201cFrance is a valued trade and investment partner.\u201d Third: \u201cFrance is a strong and reliable ally.\u201d On the third point, the official added that the U.S. has worked with France to \u201ccombat terror around the world.\u201d\n\nTerror was top of mind during the Trumps\u2019 visit to France last year for Bastille Day celebrations, where the United States was honored as \u201cnational guest of honor\u201d on the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry into World War I. The 2016 visit came just one year after an Islamic terror attack on Bastille Day celebrations in Nice, France.\n\nThe official emphasized that the visit would celebrate the 100th anniversary year of the end of World War I and that \u201cThe United States\u2019 is the third largest trading partner in Europe, and averages over $1 billion in commercial transactions every day.\u201d\n\nTrump and Macron\u2019s discussions will include, according to the official:\n\n\u2026recent joint operations in Syria in response to the Syrian regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons on April 7th; broader issues relating to Syria and the Middle East \u2014 these would include Iran\u2019s malign influence in the region; and also France\u2019s leading role in NATO and in global counterterrorism operations more generally, including in the Sahel, where France takes the leading role.\n\nPotential U.S. tariffs on European goods are expected to be on the list of discussion topics for the expanded bilateral meeting, according to the official. The Iran nuclear deal is also expected to come up. Collaborating on pushing back against certain Chinese economic practices is also on the table.\n\nOn Monday evening, the Presidents and their wives met at the White House, where they participated in a ceremonial planting of a tree the Macron\u2019s gifted to the Trumps. The tree is a \u201cEuropean Sessile Oak that measures approximately 4.5 feet tall with an estimated age between 5-10 years old,\u201d according to the White House. It has historic significance, as the tree came from Belleau Woods, a site of the United States\u2019 engagement in WWI and where \u201cover 9,000 American marines died in the Belleau Wood battle in June 1918.\u201d\n\nThe couple then traveled together on Marine One to tour historic monuments in Washington before landing at President George Washington\u2019s home at Mt. Vernon. There they enjoyed a private tour and couples dinner. After dinner, first lady Melania Trump presented a preview of the state dinner that will take place on Tuesday night. The first lady has designed Tuesday\u2019s state dinner to \u201ccomplement and pay homage to the long-standing friendship between the United States and France.\u201d\n\nTuesday night\u2019s state dinner will open with a traditional military arrival ceremony employing nearly 500 military service members and a \u201cReview of the Troops\u201d on the south lawn of the White House. The first couples will dine alongside guests from cabinet secretaries to school kids who will enjoy \u201cthe best of America\u2019s cuisines and traditions, with nuances of French influences\u201d on china acquired under the Bush 43 and Clinton administrations. The main course will be spring lamb. Adorned in thousands of white sweet peas, lilac and cherry blossoms, the event will feature the Washington National Opera.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana","13":"The Turkish Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP) announced on Wednesday that it would hold snap parliamentary elections on June 24, expected to reinforce President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s control of national policy.\n\nThe nationwide election will be the first to occur since the mass arrests of leaders of the Kurdish-friendly Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (HDP) in 2016 for allegedly supporting the terrorist Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK). The HDP significantly undermined AKP control of the Turkish parliament in the June 2015 elections, before Erdogan called a repeat election in November that undid the gains of opposition parties.\n\nErdogan told reporters on Wednesday that the election was particularly necessary in light of \u201cOperation Olive Branch,\u201d the Turkish invasion of northern Syria to eradicate the U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG\/YPJ). Turkish troops have overrun and now control Afrin, a city at the heart of Syrian Kurdistan (Rojava), and have threatened to enter nearby Manbij, where U.S. troops are stationed helping their Kurdish allies train to fight the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s cross-border operation in Syria and the situation in both Syria and Iraq obliged Turkey to overcome uncertainties as soon as possible,\u201d Erdogan said on Wednesday. \u201cAt a time when developments in Syria have accelerated and we have to take very important decisions, from macroeconomic equilibrium to large investments, the election issue should be taken off the table as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, who technically leads the parliament, confirmed that preparations for elections will \u201cstart immediately.\u201d For the election to occur on June 24, the Turkish Parliament must approve a bill calling for the vote. Lawmakers will debate the bill on April 20, according to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet.\n\nThe ruling AKP has already announced that it would begin holding election rallies in May. \u201cThe campaign process will likely start around May 15, we will have big rallies attended by the President and the Prime Minister,\u201d Islamist party spokesman Mahir Unal said on Thursday, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency. Unal claimed that \u201cthe latest polls,\u201d which Anadolu did not name, show the AKP with a lead of 55.6 percent of the vote over all other parties.\n\nAKP leaders have expressed full confidence that they will win.\n\n\u201cEarly polls will positively affect the economy. There will be no need for run-off elections. The result of the [presidential] elections is now certain after the reaction of the markets,\u201d deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozda\u011f said on Thursday. \u201cWhoever wins the elections on June 24 will have a perspective for five years. There will be no question of whether or not a government can be formed after the polls.\u201d\n\nHe joked that opposition parties seem \u201cto have been caught in the rain without an umbrella.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s major parties are the AKP, the secularist Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP), and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), which typically votes with the AKP and called for this summer\u2019s election.\n\nMaking its debut in this year\u2019s election will be the \u0130Y\u0130 (Good) Party, formed in 2017 by former Minister of the Interior Meral Aksener after her expulsion from the MHP for opposing pro-Erdogan leader Devlet Bah\u00e7eli. The \u0130Y\u0130 party stands against Erdogan\u2019s push to switch the nation away from a parliamentary system and towards a presidential one, which would grant Erdogan sweeping executive powers without any of the checks on his control that exist in presidential systems like that of the United States.\n\nAksener told reporters Wednesday that she expects her party to do well. The \u0130Y\u0130 Party will run in the election and will win,\u201d she said. On Tuesday, before the official parliamentary push for elections, Aksener insisted, \u201cthere is nothing to be alarmed about from our point of view. We have come to this stage after overcoming difficulties in the face of all the heavy smearing launched against us.\u201d\n\nTurkey last held parliamentary elections in 2015. In June of that year, the secularist, pro-religious-minority HDP gained significantly, earning 12 percent of the vote and helping chip down the number of AKP members of parliament to fewer than 276 seats.\n\nShortly following their victory, Erdogan began accusing the party of collaborating with terrorists for opposing the military takeover of southern Turkey\u2019s Diyarbakir city, home to much of the nation\u2019s Kurdish minority. Erdogan also called for a second election in November, which the AKP won handily after two million new voters mysteriously appeared on the rolls, more than the total number of new voters registered between 2011 and 2015.\n\nA year later, the two co-chairs of the HDP and a dozen other leaders of the party were arrested for allegedly collaborating with the PKK. Most remain in prison today.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if they call me a dictator or whatever else,\u201d Erdogan said shortly following the arrests. \u201cIt goes in one ear, out the other.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.","14":"On Friday\u2019s broadcast of HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time,\u201d host Bill Maher stated President Trump is \u201cobviously being blackmailed by Putin.
