{"Content":{"0":"9 Opinion\n\nWe Are Conservatives and We Believe Climate Change Is Real","1":"1. \u201cA perfectly executed strike.\u201d That\u2019s what President Trump called the American-led attack to punish Syria for its suspected use of chemical weapons. (He added a familiar phrase: \u201cMission Accomplished!\u201d)\n\nDefense officials said the strikes \u2014 which were limited in scope and carried out with Britain and France \u2014 had taken out the \u201cheart\u201d of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s chemical weapons program.\n\nBut they admitted the government had most likely retained some ability to use chemical agents. Here are seven takeaways. Above, smoke rising from the Syrian Scientific Research Center near Damascus, one of three targets.\n\nThe attack risked drawing the U.S. more deeply into a conflict with Syria\u2019s patrons, Russia and Iran. Our Moscow bureau chief reports that despite heated rhetoric, there was a sense of relief among Russian officials that it was \u201ca one-time shot,\u201d in the words of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council rejected a Russian resolution condemning the strikes.","2":"Mr. Assad has become something of a \u201chuman shield\u201d limiting Russia\u2019s options, noted Vladimir Frolov, an independent foreign affairs analyst and columnist for Republic.ru, \u201cbut it was a choice that Moscow made.\u201d\n\nPresident Putin often waits for days before weighing in on an international crisis, so his issuing a statement within hours of the attack indicated that the Kremlin considered it a critical situation.\n\nMr. Putin called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the attack. Other than that, however, he limited himself to repeating Russian claims that no chemical attack had taken place to warrant the onslaught, and that Washington was only worsening a dire humanitarian crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cRussia condemns in the strongest possible terms the attack against Syria, where Russian military personnel are assisting the legitimate government in its counterterrorism efforts,\u201d Mr. Putin said in the statement. \u201cThrough its actions, the U.S. makes the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in Syria even worse and brings suffering to civilians.\u201d\n\nLike Mr. Assad, Russia condemns all opponents of the Syrian government as \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\nThe calmer tone was a noticeable change from preceding weeks, when many commentators suggested that the United States and Russia were slouching toward a replay of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, which brought the two Cold War adversaries to the brink of a nuclear confrontation.\n\nSome Russian news outlets, while trying to make light of the panic mode, also provided practical advice, like which Moscow metro stations were the most secure against nuclear attack and how much water people should take with them to a bomb shelter.\n\nIn the weeks before the attack, Moscow issued repeated warnings, particularly from Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of staff for the armed forces, that the Kremlin would \u201ctake retaliatory measures.\u201d The general hinged his warning on the important caveat that Russia would attack missiles and the platforms from which they were launched only in the event that Russian military personnel were placed in danger.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe attack was barely over before the Defense Ministry rushed out its statement stressing that its two main installations in Syria \u2014 the air base at Hmeimim and the naval base at Tartus \u2014 had not been threatened.\n\nLt. Gen. Sergei F. Rudskoi, the head of the military\u2019s operations department, said at a briefing that no cruise missiles fired during the attack entered the Russian air-defense zones and repeated the Russian assertion that the attack had nothing to do with chemical weapons.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this strike is not a response to an alleged chemical attack, but a reaction to the successes of the Syrian armed forces in the struggle to liberate their territory from international terrorism,\u201d he said.\n\nIf anything, the Kremlin may have been somewhat pleased, albeit secretly, that the United States had hit targets well away from the primary areas of Russian control, one analyst suggested.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cRussia has its own zone of interests in Syria, which is on the shore of the Mediterranean,\u201d said Aleksei V. Makarkin, of the Center for Political Technologies.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. hit targets that are outside of this zone,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course Russia is upset, but this is just an element of the new Cold War, only one element among several, including sanctions, which are a much more serious problem for Russia.\u201d\n\nIn one telling sign of the lack of urgency regarding Syria, the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian Parliament, put out a statement saying it would discuss the airstrikes \u201cnext week.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Russia had no desire for a similar confrontation involving its regular forces.\n\nMr. Putin has twin goals in Syria. First, he is staunchly opposed to regime change fostered by outsiders of the kind that brought chaos to Iraq and Libya.\n\nSecond, he sees Syria as leverage to restore Moscow not only to its role as a power broker in the Middle East, but to the status of world policeman that it shared with the United States in Soviet days. The fact that Mr. Trump has started to criticize him and Russia more openly for allying with Mr. Assad has yet to dent those hopes.\n\nIn his speech Friday night, Mr. Trump said Russia and Iran should not want to be associated with a \u201cmass murderer\u201d like Mr. Assad, and \u2014 as he did after a more limited attack on Syria for the same reason a year ago \u2014 declared that Mr. Putin and Russia had failed to fulfill the promise to eliminate all Syria\u2019s chemical weapons.\n\n\u201cRussia must decide if it will continue down this dark path or if it will join with civilized nations as a force for stability and peace,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHopefully, someday we\u2019ll get along with Russia and maybe even Iran, but maybe not.\u201d\n\nMr. Putin will accept limited strikes against Syria that do not indicate a sustained American effort to help the opposition, said Mr. Frolov, the foreign affairs analyst, and would avoid engaging Mr. Trump on the rest.\n\n\u201cThe Kremlin is still hoping for a summit with Trump, so it will largely ignore his comments about Putin,\u201d Mr. Frolov said. \u201cThere is still some residual hope that a good personal meeting may turn things around.\u201d\n\nThe Russians did crow that Syrian air defense systems had managed to shoot down a dozen or so cruise missiles, using equipment \u201cmanufactured more than 30 years ago in the Soviet Union,\u201d according to the Interfax news agency. The United States military did not confirm or deny the assertion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry greeted the missile attack with its habitual sarcasm. Without naming the United States specifically, Maria Zakharova, the spokesman for the ministry, zeroed in on the claims of moral leadership and exceptionalism among the allies who launched the attack.\n\n\u201cYou have to be really exceptional to shell Syria\u2019s capital at the moment when the country is getting a chance for a peaceful future,\u201d she wrote on Facebook.\n\nIn a news briefing on Saturday, a spokeswoman for the United States Defense Department, Dana W. White, said, \u201cThe Russian disinformation campaign has already begun.\u201d She noted, \u201cThere has been a 2,000 percent increase in Russian trolls in the last 24 hours.\u201d\n\nEven with the immediate threat of a confrontation out of the way, several Russian analysts noted that the proximity of the two sides in Syria, not to mention the shifting positions of Mr. Trump, left plenty of room for confrontation.\n\n\u201cThe danger is that at one point something completely unexpected and spontaneous can happen \u2014 for instance a missile can miss its target and hit something sensitive,\u201d said Mr. Makarkin.","3":"We are now in the midst of an epic clash between Donald Trump and fired F.B.I. Director James Comey, neither of whom I hold in high esteem, both men with raging egos and questionable motives.\n\nThe depth of my contempt differs between the two, but there is contempt for both.\n\nComey is now making the rounds promoting his new book, which will no doubt be a monster best seller. Good for him. But Comey for me is a complicated character, a man of honorable service and flashes of horrendous judgment.\n\nHis inexplicable handling of the investigations into Clinton\u2019s emails is unforgivable.\n\nHe made reckless and harmful disclosures and proclamations about the Clinton investigation while not whispering a word about the concurrent investigation into the Trump campaign.\n\nHe says that the letter he released about a new phase of the Clinton email investigation just days before the election may have been colored by polling suggesting that Clinton was going to win, but that too is problematic.","4":"Those changes were all approved in a referendum last year that Mr. Erdogan had campaigned for strenuously, with the obvious intention that he would be the first president to hold the enhanced office.\n\nMr. Erdogan has since been urging members of his Justice and Development Party to work to build enough support for him to secure the election in the first round.\n\n\u201cAlthough its seems there are no serious issues arising as the president and the government are working in harmony, the diseases of the old system can confront us at every step,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said in a speech broadcast live on television. \u201cFor our country to make decisions about the future more strongly and apply them, passing to the new governmental system becomes urgent.\u201d\n\nMinutes later, the Turkish Parliament approved a request from Prime Minister Binali Yildirim to extend the state of emergency \u2014 which has been in force since the failed coup \u2014 for another three months, the Turkish news agency Anadolu reported.\n\nWhile the coup attempt was violent \u2014 nearly 250 people died, including Mr. Erdogan\u2019s election campaign manager and close friend \u2014 critics have since accused him of using the extended powers under emergency rule to crack down on political opponents and dissent.\n\nTens of thousands have been jailed, accused of links to Fethullah Gulen, the Islamist cleric accused of masterminding the coup, or to other designated terrorist organizations. And over 100,000 people have been suspended from public-sector jobs. Mr. Gulen has denied involvement in the coup.\n\nDefense Minister Nurettin Canikli said Wednesday that the government had identified three thousand top-level officers belonging to the Gulen movement inside the military, and was preparing to purge them soon with a government decree, the Anadolu news agency reported.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Erdogan said that events in Syria and Iraq, both countries in which Turkey has deployed troops, had made a transition to the presidential system more urgent. He also said the economic situation demanded certainty.\n\n\u201cWith the cross-border operations we maintain in Syria, and also historical events happening in the area centered around Syria and Iraq, it became a must for Turkey to climb over the uncertainty as soon as possible,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cIn a period where developments about Syria accelerate, and we have to make very important decisions on issues from macroeconomic equilibrium to big investments, it is a must to drop the election issue from the agenda as soon as possible,\u201d he added.\n\nYet political opponents and commentators have been predicting for months that Mr. Erdogan would call early elections as soon as he could be sure of winning. He is known to closely watch opinion polls and has enjoyed a bounce in his personal rating since ordering military operations against Kurdish militias in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin in January.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Inflation remains persistently high, which hurts many of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s own supporters.\n\nThe snap election was also seen as a move to undercut political opponents.\n\nMr. Erdogan\u2019s announcement came after discussions with Devlet Bahceli, the leader of Turkey\u2019s main nationalist party, the Nationalist Movement Party, which has entered a formal alliance with Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., for the elections.\n\nMr. Bahceli said that he supported early elections for the stability of the country and the economy. But he also seems to be concerned with fending off a rival for the nationalist vote, Meral Aksener, who split from his party and formed her own party, the Good Party, last year, according to Turkish media reports.\n\nThe early timing of the election now could prevent Ms. Aksener from running, since her new party may not be considered to have passed the required six months from its first party congress.\n\nMs. Aksener, a former interior minister, has nevertheless declared her intention to challenge Mr. Erdogan for president and field candidates for Parliament.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTurkey\u2019s largest opposition party, the Republican People\u2019s Party, or C.H.P., was caught flat-footed by the announcement, and has not yet selected a candidate for president. Its leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, ruled out running for the presidency last year.\n\nEngin Altay, the deputy head of C.H.P.\u2019s parliamentary group, told a Turkish television station that a candidate would be chosen within 15 days.\n\nThe pro-Kurdish party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party, or H.D.P., has particularly suffered under the state of emergency, with nine members of Parliament in jail, including their popular former leader Selahattin Demirtas and many mayors removed from their posts. The party nevertheless has appointed new leaders and declared itself ready for elections.\n\nSezai Temelli, the co-chairman of the party, said in a tweet: \u201cJune 24 is not early, but a panic election. The government is impotent.\u201d\n\nTo win outright in the first round of the election, Mr. Erdogan will need to secure 51 percent of the vote. His personal ratings have been closer to 40 percent in recent opinion polls.\n\nThe constitutional changes to create a new presidential system were agreed in a controversial referendum in April last year, which Mr. Erdogan only barely won with a 51 percent yes vote, versus 49 percent who voted no.\n\nMs. Aksener was a prominent leader of the no campaign and has vowed to assemble similar broad support for the coming elections.\n\nThe referendum was criticized as unfair by opposition parties and independent election monitors. Since then, Mr. Erdogan has moved to exercise greater control over the High Election Board and the electoral law, the parties warned.\n\n\u201cThe alliance cannot secure 50 percent,\u201d Yalcin Dogan wrote in the online news outlet T24. \u201cSo they are changing the structure of the High Election Board and the electoral law in a manner that is against the universal democratic rules. However, the Good Party remains a complete nightmare.\u201d","5":"The surprise announcement came last week, just hours after President Xi Jinping reviewed the biggest naval parade in the country\u2019s history, above.

But I first want to spend a few moments on the perception gap, because it highlights a problem that\u2019s bigger than budget policy.\n\nThe country\u2019s political impressions are heavily influenced by people who are supposed to be neutral observers \u2014 reporters, television anchors, think-tank experts and the like. They\u2019re not perfectly neutral, of course. They have their biases. But most aspire to partisan neutrality. It\u2019s an honorable aspiration.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not easy to achieve. For one thing, they\u2019re inundated by partisan advocates. If your job involved listening to people claim that, say, the Obama administration\u2019s Syria policy was a success or that George W. Bush\u2019s economic record was underrated, you too would develop a robust skepticism.\n\nThe problem is this skepticism often morphs into a formulaic approach that can itself become untethered from reality. Whatever the facts, many journalists and Washington experts revert to familiar storylines: Both sides are hypocritical. The parties care more about scoring partisan points than getting anything done. The extremists have taken over, and there are no moderates left.\n\nAll of these storylines have at least some truth to them. Like a stopped clock, they sometimes have a lot of truth. But they are indeed like a stopped clock. They never change.","7":"Of course, we are not blind to the discord and disarray resulting from Iran\u2019s actions and attitude in the region. We strongly condemn its contribution to the war in Syria and its backing of the murderous government of President Bashar al-Assad, as well as Iran\u2019s support, by varying degrees, of nonstate actors like Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. However, by taking the threat that Iran would develop a nuclear weapon off the table, the pact has effectively limited that country\u2019s means to carry out its destabilizing activities.\n\nThose are the reasons that France, Germany and Britain, which form the E3 group, continue to support the agreement and are calling on President Trump to make good on the commitment we took, together with the United States, on July 14, 2015, in Vienna. Now we, members of parliaments in the E3, have decided to raise our voices to tell the United States Congress that we stand by our trans-Atlantic commitments and to warn of the disastrous consequences of an American withdrawal from the Vienna agreement.\n\nTo that end, we have written a letter being published Thursday and Friday by leading newspapers in France, Germany and Britain calling on the members of Congress to bring their full backing to the nuclear deal and prevent their government from pulling out of this major diplomatic achievement. The letter has been signed by more than 500 members of France\u2019s National Assembly, Germany\u2019s Bundestag and Britain\u2019s House of Commons. The signatories as of Thursday afternoon \u2014 362 French, 70 British and 75 German \u2014 represent the entire political spectrum of our home countries. They may disagree on internal policies and on other international issues, but they agree on one thing: The compact is a major achievement of our collective security, in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nAs elected representatives, we have taken this extraordinary step of rallying hundreds of our fellow members of parliament across our political aisles, and of reaching out to our American colleagues, because we firmly believe that the diplomatic strength of a strong and unified trans-Atlantic partnership is needed today more than ever. As Europeans, we are undertaking this cross-European, cross-parliamentary initiative to show the international community that Europe\u2019s democracies will rise in solidarity on critical international problems.\n\nWe are pleading to the men and women of Congress to play their part in keeping the nuclear deal alive. We know that the citizens we represent are the people who make the formulas of our shared values come alive every day. With equal fervor on both sides of the Atlantic, they strive for liberty and believe in human rights and the rule of law. These are principles upon which we can build a more just world order.","8":"The justices will consider how much weight to give to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign statements. And they will act in the shadow of their own decision in Korematsu v. United States, which endorsed Roosevelt\u2019s 1942 order and is almost universally viewed as a shameful mistake.\n\nThe Justice Department has worked hard to limit the damage from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign statements, which were often extemporaneous and rambling. It was hard to tell, for instance, precisely which Roosevelt policies Mr. Trump referred to or endorsed in his 2015 remarks.\n\n\u201cImpugning the official objective of a formal national security and foreign policy judgment of the president based on campaign trail statements is inappropriate and fraught with intractable difficulties,\u201d Solicitor General Noel J.

Roosevelt\u2019s order applied to people living in the United States, many of them citizens, while Mr. Trump\u2019s order concerned nationals of other countries living abroad.

Last week, the administration lifted restrictions on travel from Chad.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn enforcing Roosevelt\u2019s order, moreover, the military singled out \u201cpersons of Japanese ancestry.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s order, by contrast, is neutral on its face, though it disproportionately affects Muslims.\n\nStill, the legacy of the Korematsu decision figured in opinions in recent appeals court decisions blocking Mr. Trump\u2019s third and most considered travel ban, issued as a presidential proclamation in September.\n\nThe Korematsu decision occupies a curious place in the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence, as a grave error that has never been formally disavowed.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia wrote that Korematsu ranks with Dred Scott, the 1857 decision that black slaves were property and not citizens, as among the court\u2019s most disastrous rulings.\n\nIn 1982, a congressional commission concluded that the internment of Japanese-Americans was \u201ca grave injustice\u201d animated by \u201crace prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership.\u201d It added that \u201cthe decision in Korematsu lies overruled in the court of history.\u201d\n\nBut the Supreme Court has never overruled the decision. It remains, in the words of Justice Robert Jackson\u2019s dissent, \u201ca loaded weapon, ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need.\u201d\n\nThe supporting briefs in the new case, Trump v. Hawaii, No. 17-965, urged the justices to consider the similarities between the two executive orders. \u201cThen, as now,\u201d one said, \u201cthe government pursued a mass exclusionary measure of sweeping and senseless scope.\u201d Both orders, the briefs said, relied on general characteristics like ancestry and nationality in the place of individualized scrutiny.\n\nIn defending the Japanese internment, the Justice Department told the Supreme Court that \u201cthe group as a whole contained an unknown number of persons who could not readily be singled out and who were a threat to the security of the nation.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order bars entry of large numbers of people \u201cabout whom the United States lacks sufficient information to assess the risks they pose.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Neal K. Katyal, then the acting United States solicitor general, issued a \u201cconfession of error\u201d for the actions of government lawyers in the Korematsu case. Mr. Katyal now represents the challengers in the case against Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban, and he may face an uphill fight next week. In December, the Supreme Court allowed the latest travel ban to take effect while the case moved forward, with only two justices noting dissents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut there is little doubt that all of the justices view the case as momentous. On Friday, the court announced that it would release an audio recording of the arguments shortly after they end. That is a rare step, one the court reserves for cases likely to face historical scrutiny.","9":"Meanwhile, leaked complaints of harassment and incompetence from Paris Opera Ballet dancers have set off a furor and spurred resignations, the latest scandal to hit the world of ballet.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2022 In Germany, a prize for best hip-hop album went to two rap artists, above, whose lyrics mocked the Holocaust and Auschwitz victims.

That may be about to change, and if it does, it will have vast implications for Syria, Lebanon and the whole Middle East.\n\nI\u2019m sure neither side really wants a war. It could be devastating for Israel\u2019s flourishing high-tech economy and for Iran\u2019s already collapsing currency. But Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Quds Force seems determined to try to turn Syria into a base from which to pressure Israel, and Israel seems determined to prevent that. And in the past few weeks \u2014 for the first time ever \u2014 Israel and Iran have begun quietly trading blows directly, not through proxies, in Syria.\n\nThey have already gone through two rounds, and Round 3, now pending, could blow Syria sky-high.\n\nRound 1 occurred on Feb. 10, when an Iranian drone launched by a Quds Force unit operating out of Syria\u2019s T4 air base, in central Syria, was shot down with a missile from an Israeli Apache helicopter that was following it after it penetrated northern Israel airspace.\n\nInitial reports were that the drone was purely on a reconnaissance mission. But the Israeli Army\u2019s spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, said Friday that the flight path and Israel\u2019s analysis of the drone indicated that \u201cthe aircraft was carrying explosives\u201d and that its mission was \u201can act of sabotage in Israeli territory.\u201d","11":"Representative Ed Royce, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said his committee would hold a hearing in the coming days to examine American policy in the region.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nSenator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, who sits on both the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, said that Mr. Trump had seriously erred in not seeking Congress\u2019s consent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to launch airstrikes against the Syrian government without Congress\u2019s approval is illegal and \u2014 absent a broader strategy \u2014 it\u2019s reckless,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kaine warned that allowing Mr. Trump to strike a foreign power without such authorization could provide a dangerous precedent.\n\n\u201cToday, it\u2019s a strike on Syria \u2014 what\u2019s going to stop him from bombing Iran or North Korea next?\u201d he said.\n\nAt the insistence of Mr. Kaine and others, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to begin debate this month on a new authorization of military force against terrorist and other extremist groups, including in Syria. The authorization, commonly referred to as an A.U.M.F., would replace a law passed shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nBut it would not address Mr. Assad\u2019s government or the possibility of a larger use of force to intervene in the Syrian civil war.\n\nPhoto\n\nA handful of Republicans joined Democrats in questioning the validity of the operation. Representative Thomas Massie, a conservative Republican from Kentucky, quipped on Twitter that he could not recall the Constitution giving the president the authority to strike Syria.\n\nIn a statement, Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, warned that \u201cit is vitally important that the Trump administration honors the Constitution by working with Congress on further military action.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States is not at war with the people of Syria, and I anticipate that the administration will quickly present their long-term intentions to the American people,\u201d he continued.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, not all Republicans had reservations. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters in Congress, gave unqualified approval.\n\n\u201cThe Butcher of Damascus learned two lessons tonight the hard way,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Assad. \u201cWeapons of mass destruction won\u2019t create a military advantage once the United States is done with you, and Russia cannot protect its clients from the United States.\u201d\n\nAnd Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, urged the administration to act more aggressively, fretting, \u201cI fear that when the dust settles this strike will be seen as a weak military response, and Assad will have paid a small price for using chemical weapons yet again.\u201d\n\n\u201cAssad has likely calculated a limited American strike is just the cost of doing business,\u201d he said. \u201cRussia and Iran will view the limited action as the United States being content to drop a few bombs before heading for the exits.\u201d","12":"Administration and congressional officials said the hawkish Mr. Bolton is not expected to defer to the defense secretary; already, neoconservative members of the Republican foreign policy establishment have started to air concerns that Mr. Mattis is ceding strategic territory to Iran and Russia in Syria.\n\nMr. Mattis is widely viewed by global leaders as the strongest and perhaps most credible voice on foreign policy in an administration that has been rocked by firings and resignations among senior presidential advisers. The recent exits of both General McMaster and Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state have focused more attention on Mr. Mattis\u2019s role in the cabinet.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefed lawmakers on Capitol Hill about the Syria airstrikes in closed-door meetings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to put a check on this president, on any president, when it comes to Congress\u2019s constitutional responsibility to wage war,\u201d Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, said in an interview on Tuesday. She called last week\u2019s Syria\u2019s strikes \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nAs he pressed his case last week, before the allied strikes with Britain and France, Mr. Mattis lost the battle over getting congressional authorization. But he won the larger war.\n\nMr. Mattis prevailed in limiting the strikes to three targets that did not risk endangering Russian troops scattered at military installations around Syria. Nor did the 105 missiles hit Syrian military units believed to be responsible for carrying out an April 7 suspected chemical weapons attack on Douma, near Damascus.\n\nIn the end, the narrowly targeted strikes belied Mr. Trump\u2019s description Friday night of a larger coordinated response that could take days or weeks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe combined American, British and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power \u2014 military, economic and diplomatic,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an address to the nation as the strikes were underway. \u201cWe are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.\u201d\n\nBut there have been no additional strikes since then, and the Pentagon said no more are being planned. \u201cThis is a one-time shot,\u201d Mr. Mattis said on Friday, calling the airstrikes \u201ca very strong message to dissuade\u201d President Bashar al-Assad of Syria from using chemical weapons against his own people.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s drumbeat of threats last week of a sharp response to the suspected gas attacks all but guaranteed that the United States military would strike Syria, according to two Defense Department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nEven so, Mr. Mattis pushed to get congressional authorization, according to people with knowledge of the internal debate. In several White House meetings last week, he underscored the importance of linking military operations to public support \u2014 a view Mr. Mattis has long held.\n\nCol. Patrick S. Ryder of the Air Force, a spokesman for General Dunford, on Tuesday declined to discuss the internal debate between the Pentagon and the White House over the strikes\u2019 reach before they were launched.\n\nIt marked the second public divergence of views between Mr. Trump and Mr. Mattis over Syria in the past two weeks.\n\nJust days before the suspected chemical attack, the president said he was ready for the estimated 2,000 American troops currently in Syria to leave the battlefield, where they have been fighting alongside Kurdish allies against the Islamic State. Mr. Mattis and other aides quickly talked him out an immediate withdrawal.\n\nPentagon officials said there was also worry that congressional opposition to American military engagements that still rely on authorizations approved after the 2001 terrorist attacks could grow without getting Capitol Hill onboard before striking at Mr. Assad\u2019s chemical weapons program.\n\nMr. Trump did not necessarily want to hit Syria hard enough to bring Russia into the war, administration officials said. But he did want to appear aggressive in his response.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe just wants the big show,\u201d said Derek Chollet, an assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. \u201cSo Mattis was probably pushing on an open door.\u201d\n\nMr. Mattis is particularly concerned about overextending the American military in Syria. He does not want the United States to veer from its stated policy of focusing only on the fight in Syria against the Islamic State \u2014 and avoid delving into the country\u2019s seven-year civil war.\n\nRussian forces and Iranian militias have helped Mr. Assad remain in power against Syrian opposition fighters who accuse him of a brutal siege against the country.\n\n\u201cThe strike was really just enough to cover the president politically, but not enough to spark a war with the Russians,\u201d said Jon Soltz, a two-tour veteran of the Iraq war who is chairman of the liberal veterans group VoteVets. \u201cIt was clear the military had tight constraints on the operation, and that everybody in the military seemed to know that except the president.\u201d\n\nMr. Mattis publicly disputed suggestions on Tuesday that the limited strikes amounted to little more than a public relations punch at Mr. Assad.\n\n\u201cThe French, the United Kingdom, the United States, allies, all NATO allies, we worked together to maintain the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons,\u201d Mr. Mattis said at the Pentagon. \u201cWe did what we believe was right under international law, under our nation\u2019s laws.\n\n\u201cAnd I hope that this time, the Assad regime got the message,\u201d Mr. Mattis said.","13":"The list was seen as an ominous sign that Mr. Orban intended to punish those who had opposed him before his recent election to a third term in office.\n\nThe protests reflect the deep divisions in the Central European country that has been at the forefront of a regional drift away from liberal Western values.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2022 \u201cYou do not go to a war zone with men who miss their mama.\u201d\n\nFaced with an aging military, the Belgian Army proposed a change that it hopes will attract younger soldiers: letting recruits sleep at home on weekdays during basic training.\n\nBut the proposal has drawn scorn from veterans and military experts who argue that the policy could undermine unit cohesion and set a dangerous precedent for other Western armies.\n\n(Above, Belgian soldiers in Brussels in March 2016.)\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2022 Trials in France and Northern Ireland have stirred uproars over the sexual and legal treatment of women and girls.\n\nIn France, a court case involving a 28-year-old man who had sex with an 11-year-old girl centers on the question of whether she was raped, since French law does not hold that children are automatically too young to consent. The trial has spurred government efforts to change laws to better protect minors, but critics say the changes don\u2019t go far enough.\n\nAnd the recent acquittal of two Irish rugby players who were accused of raping a drunk woman has stirred furious debate over attitudes toward masculinity and sexual consent. Above, one of the acquitted rugby players, Paddy Jackson, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in March.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2022 \u201cHe is morally unfit to be president.\u201d\n\nThat was James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, above right, describing President Trump in his first televised interview since he was fired last May. Mr. Comey called Mr. Trump a serial liar who treated women like \u201cmeat\u201d and described him as a \u201cstain\u201d on everyone who worked for him.\n\nHis memoir, \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d comes out on Tuesday. Our former chief book critic, Michiko Kakutani, returned to review the book, which portrays Mr. Trump as unethical and dishonest.\n\nMr. Comey\u2019s publicity juggernaut is a remarkable public assault on a sitting president by someone who served at the highest levels in the government, and the stakes could hardly be higher for both men.\n\nFor days, Mr. Trump has waged a ferocious counterattack against Mr. Comey, calling him a liar and a \u201cslime ball.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Morning Briefing What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox.

But the strike does really call into question the wisdom of pulling back American forces now in highlighting the question of what our objective really is in Syria.\u201d\n\nOthers argued that the strike was a waste that accomplished little and, in the process, exceeded the president\u2019s authority as commander in chief since he did not obtain authorization from Congress first. Critics said that if Mr. Trump was truly moved by humanitarian concern over the victims of last weekend\u2019s attack, he should reverse his policy of barring virtually any new Syrian refugees from the United States.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing bloodshed and war crimes in Syria are a stark reminder that Syrian civilians need our support now more than ever,\u201d Noah Gottschalk of Oxfam America said in a statement. \u201cYet the Trump administration still lacks a coherent strategy to actually bring an end to the conflict and instead has sought to slash humanitarian aid and slam the door on Syrian refugees.\u201d\n\nBy most accounts, the strike essentially left in place the status quo on the ground. It did little if anything to weaken Mr. Assad beyond any chemical weapons stores it destroyed, leaving him to continue waging war on his own people through conventional means. It did nothing to exact the \u201cbig price\u201d Mr. Trump promised to impose on Russia and Iran for enabling Mr. Assad\u2019s chemical attacks.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Trump has shown little interest in trying to steer Syria to a resolution of its civil war, eschewing the sort of Geneva diplomacy that absorbed Mr. Obama\u2019s last secretary of state, John F. Kerry, to little apparent effect. Mr. Trump sees Syria in two boxes \u2014 the fight against the Islamic State, in which he has declared near victory, and the multisided civil war that he wants no part of, saying as he did just days ago, \u201cLet the other people take care of it now.\u201d\n\nBut that is an artificial bifurcation in a country torn by violence on all sides. The civil war affects the ability of the Islamic State to operate and vice versa. Mr. Trump may have opted for the more cautious approach urged by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis instead of a more crippling attack that may have been favored by his new national security adviser, John R. Bolton, but he did not settle the larger question.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAsked on Friday before the missiles began flying to explain America\u2019s strategy in Syria, Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get ahead of the president,\u201d she said.\n\nEven when the president spoke later that night, he was somewhat vague in describing his own strategy. While he said he was \u201cprepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents,\u201d he did not explain what he meant or how far he was willing to go beyond saying he would also use economic and diplomatic tools.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Biden Jr., said Mr. Trump \u201cwisely avoided hitting regime targets where there was a significant risk of killing Russians\u201d but for that very reason did little real harm to Mr. Assad.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the relatively cautious nature of the strike signaled that we were deterred from taking larger action, potentially undercutting the credible U.S. threat of doing more down the line if the regime continues to use chemical weapons,\u201d he said.\n\nFundamentally, these factors are not that different than they were during Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, but Mr. Trump often seems unaware of history, even recent history. His use of the phrase \u201cmission accomplished\u201d on Saturday, for example, invited unwelcome comparisons to Mr. Bush\u2019s experience.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Bush appeared on the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln in May 2003 after American troops toppled Saddam Hussein in Iraq and declared the end of major combat operations. Behind him was a large banner declaring \u201cMission Accomplished,\u201d which White House aides later said was meant as a congratulations to the carrier crew returning home but became a metaphor for miscalculation as a virulent insurgency consumed Iraq.\n\n\u201cUm...I would have recommended ending this tweet with not those two words,\u201d Ari Fleischer, who was Mr. Bush\u2019s White House press secretary at the time, wrote on Twitter on Saturday. When Mr. Bush made his appearance in spring 2003, he said, the words seemed fitting. \u201cBy the Fall,\u201d he added, \u201cthe shot of Bush with the banner became a symbol of what went wrong.\u201d\n\nPhilip H. Gordon, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s White House coordinator of Middle East policy, said one of the challenges for Mr. Trump was calibrating his language with his actions. In effect, Mr. Gordon said, the president seemed to be trying to find a reasoned middle ground in Syria that belies his own tough talk.\n\n\u201cYou can make a case that we are trying to thread a needle that\u2019s tough to thread, but the needle is to do enough to deter the regime from using chemical weapons but not so much that sucks us into the Syrian civil war and gets us into conflict with Iran and Russia,\u201d he said.\n\nRather than pay attention to Mr. Trump\u2019s words, Mr. Gordon said the strategy was better articulated by Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and Mr. Mattis, who described the strike as an effort to stop Mr. Assad from using chemical weapons but noted that it was not intended to achieve broader goals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat May and Mattis said could be considered a legitimate strategy,\u201d Mr. Gordon said. \u201cThe risk is, with this president and this administration, is he going to be disciplined enough and restrained enough to thread that needle?

But Prime Minister Orban\u2019s easy win in Hungary\u2019s national election on April 8 and the success of antiestablishment parties in Italy a month earlier have signaled otherwise. To the east, Russia\u2019s brazen violation of international norms has only increased despite broad economic sanctions \u2014 witness the chemical assault on a double agent in Britain, while to the west, the Trump administration relentlessly pursues its chaotic assault on American values and traditions.\n\nMr. Macron said political change was inevitable, but it should not mean abandonment of democratic principles.\n\n\u201cIndeed, in these difficult times, European democracy is our best chance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst possible mistake would be to give up on our model and our identity.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe see authoritarians all around us, and the answer is not authoritarian democracy, but the authority of democracy.\u201d\n\nMr. Macron is not without political weaknesses. He has been called \u201cJupiter\u201d for his haughty style, and his economic reforms at home are being challenged by a wave of strikes. His proposals for a closer financial convergence in the eurozone have been met with a cool response in Germany. Yet the French president is one of the rare European leaders who unabashedly believe in Europe\u2019s future, especially as Britain prepares to exit the European Union and America\u2019s leadership erodes. Though he has cultivated a strategic rapport with President Trump, providing French forces for the punitive strike on Syria last weekend, for example, Mr. Macron drew a distinction in his speech between Europe and an America that was \u201crejecting multilateralism, free trade and climate change.\u201d\n\nIt may be that the West is going through a temporary backlash against globalization, terrorism, migration, social upheavals and technological change that have swept so rapidly around the world, and that Mr. Macron is exaggerating when he sees a \u201ccertain European civil war\u201d in the political turmoil. Yet, in Hungary, Mr. Orban opened his fourth term as prime minister with a national hate campaign against George Soros, the Hungarian-American funder of liberal projects, and with plans for a legislative campaign against nongovernmental groups that help immigrants and refugees. Late last year the European Union formally put Poland on notice that its assault on the judiciary was a serious breach of union rules. And the vulgar soap opera in Washington shows no signs of ending.","18":"Mr. Abe meets President Xi Jinping in China later this year and possibly even North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un.\n\nBut his political standing has been damaged by domestic scandals, and some have questioned whether he might resign when the current session of Parliament ends in June.\n\nEven if Mr. Abe can claim some kind of victory in his meeting with Mr. Trump, it is unclear whether it will help him. \u201cEven now the vultures are starting to circle,\u201d one analyst said.\n\n_____\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2022 A fog of contradictions in Syria.\n\nWestern officials said Russia and Syria prevented inspectors from reaching Douma, where about 70 people died on April 7 in a suspected chemical attack by President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces.

Babas is the plural.\n\nThe baba originated in France, and was supposedly inspired by the Polish king Stanislaw I, whose daughter, Marie, married King Louis XV. It is said that Stanislaw was partial to the Alsatian Gugelhupf cake, though he discovered that the dry dough tasted better when dipped in liquor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Parisian baker Nicolas Stohrer went on to popularize this combination, and one of his descendants eventually established rum as the alcohol of choice. Stohrer\u2019s patisserie is still around today.\n\nBabas have continued to be a staple of French baking, and the success of the cake has carried over to Italy and the United States. Babas are now often made with raisins in their dough, and they usually resemble Bundt cakes or doughnuts in shape. Variations may use sweet wine or liqueur in place of rum.\n\nDeb Amlen contributed reporting.\n\n_____\n\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.
