{"Content":{"0":"THE HAGUE\/BEIRUT (Reuters) - A U.N. security team came under fire in Syria while doing reconnaissance for inspectors to visit sites of a suspected chemical weapons attack, and officials said it was no longer clear when the inspectors would be able to go in.\n\nThe inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are in Syria to investigate an April 7 incident in which Western countries and rescue workers say scores of civilians were gassed to death by government forces.\n\nOPCW Director-General Ahmet \u00dcz\u00fcmc\u00fc said the United Nations Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) had decided to carry out reconnaissance at two sites in the town of Douma before the inspectors would visit them.\n\n\u201cOn arrival at site one, a large crowd gathered and the advice provided by the UNDSS was that the reconnaissance team should withdraw,\u201d he told a meeting at the watchdog\u2019s headquarters in remarks it later released. \u201cAt site two, the team came under small arms fire and an explosive was detonated. The reconnaissance team returned to Damascus.\u201d\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis blamed the Syrian government for delays in inspectors reaching the sites and said it has a history of trying to \u201cclean up the evidence before the investigation team gets in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are very much aware of the delay that the regime imposed on that delegation but we are also very much aware of how they have operated in the past and seal what they have done using chemical weapons,\u201d Mattis said before the start of a meeting with his counterpart from Qatar.\n\nThe United States, Britain and France fired missiles at Syrian targets on Saturday in retaliation for the suspected chemical use. They say the arrival of the inspectors is being held up by Syrian authorities who now control the area, and that evidence of the chemical attack may be being destroyed.\n\nDamascus and its ally Moscow deny that any gas attack took place, that they are holding up the inspections or that they have tampered with evidence at the site. Britain\u2019s ambassador to the OPCW Peter Wilson said it was now unclear when the inspectors would be able to reach it.\n\nThe rebel group based in Douma announced its surrender hours after the suspected chemical attack, and the last rebels left a week later, hours after the Western retaliation strikes.\n\nThe U.S.-led intervention has threatened to escalate confrontation between the West and Assad\u2019s backer Russia, although it has had no impact on the fighting on the ground, in which pro-government forces have pressed on with a campaign to crush the rebellion.\n\nAssad is now in his strongest position since the early months of a seven-year-old civil war that has killed more than 500,000 people and driven more than half of Syrians from their homes.\n\nDELAY CAUSES DISPUTE\n\nThe OPCW team will seek evidence from soil samples, interviews with witnesses, blood, urine or tissue samples from victims and weapon parts. But, more than a week after the suspected attack, hard evidence might be hard to trace.\n\nAn official close to the Syrian government said the U.N. security team had been met by protesters demonstrating against the U.S.-led strikes.\n\n\u201cIt was a message from the people,\u201d said the official. The mission \u201cwill continue its work\u201d, the official said.\n\nDouma was the last town to hold out in the besieged eastern Ghouta enclave, the last big rebel bastion near the capital Damascus. Eastern Ghouta was captured by a government advance over the past two months.\n\nSyria\u2019s U.N. ambassador said on Tuesday the fact-finding mission would begin its work in Douma on Wednesday if the U.N. security team deemed the situation there safe.\n\nThe Syrian \u201cWhite Helmets\u201d rescue organization, which operates in rebel-held areas, has pinpointed for the OPCW team the places where victims of the suspected attack are buried, its head Raed Saleh said on Wednesday.\n\nDouma hospital workers who stayed in the town after the army recaptured it have said that none of the people injured on the night of the attack were exposed to chemical weapons.\n\nMedical charities operating in opposition-held parts of Syria have dismissed those statements as propaganda, given under duress now that government forces control the town.\n\nThe United Nation vehicle carrying the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inspectors is seen in Damascus, Syria April 17, 2018.

REUTERS\/Ammar Awad\/File Photo\n\nIran, along with Damascus and its big-power backer Russia, blamed Israel for an April 9 air strike on a Syrian air base, T-4, that killed seven Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) members. Iranian officials have promised unspecified reprisals.\n\nIsraeli media ran satellite images and a map of five Syrian air bases allegedly used to field Iranian drones or cargo aircraft, as well as the names of three senior IRGC officers suspected of commanding related projects, such as missile units.\n\nThe information came from the Israeli military, according to a wide range of television and radio stations and news websites. Israel\u2019s military spokesman declined to comment.\n\nHowever, an Israeli security official seemed to acknowledge the leak was sanctioned, telling Reuters that it provided details about \u201cthe IRGC air force (which) the Israeli defense establishment sees as the entity that will try to attack Israel, based on Iranian threats to respond to the strike on T-4.\u201d\n\nThe official, who requested anonymity, would not elaborate.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Army Radio reported that, given tensions with Iran over Syria, the Israeli air force canceled plans to send F-15 fighter jets to take part in the U.S.-hosted exercise Red Flag, which begins on April 30.\n\n\u201cEXPOSED\u201d\n\nRoni Daniel, military editor for Israeli TV station Mako, said the disclosure was a signal to Iran that its deployments in Syria \u201care totally exposed to us, and if you take action against us to avenge (the T-4 strike) these targets will be very severely harmed\u201d.\n\nAccording to Daniel, Israel was bracing for a possible Iranian missile salvo or armed drone assault from Syria.\n\nThere was no immediate response from the IRGC or Syria.\n\nThe Iranian death toll in T-4 was unusually high. \u201cIt was the first time we attacked live Iranian targets - both facilities and people,\u201d the New York Times on Sunday quoted an Israeli military source as saying.\n\nIran, Israel\u2019s arch-foe, has cast its military personnel in Syria as reinforcements helping President Bashar al-Assad battle a seven-year-old insurgency. The Iranians have also described their cargo flights to Syria as carrying humanitarian aid only.\n\nAn Israeli-Iranian showdown over Syria has loomed since Feb. 10, when Israel said an armed drone launched from T-4 penetrated its air space. Israel blew up the drone and carried out a raid on Syrian air defenses in which one of its F-16 jets was downed.\n\n\u201cIsrael is headed for escalation,\u201d Yaacov Amidror, former national security adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told Tel Aviv radio station 103 FM. \u201cThere could be a very big belligerent incident with Iran and Hezbollah.\u201d\n\nWhile not claiming responsibility for the T-4 strike, Israel has restated a policy of preventing Iran setting up a Syrian garrison. Scores of previous such raids went unanswered but Israel worries that changing conditions may now embolden Iran.\n\nRussia, which long turned a blind eye to Israeli actions in Syria while serving as a brake on retaliation by Iran or its Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla allies, is now at loggerheads with Western powers over accusations, denied by Syria\u2019s government, that it has used chemical weaponry in fighting.","2":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - About 10 days ago, U.S. President Donald Trump told national security aides that he wanted U.S. forces out of Syria in six months or so, adamant that it was time to bring them home after largely defeating Islamic State militants.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump makes a statement about Syria at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 13, 2018.

Trump had been scheduled to attend but stayed in Washington to focus on Syria.\n\nPence abruptly left the summit\u2019s opening ceremonies and returned to his hotel in time to make secure phone calls to congressional leaders to tell them about the strikes.\n\nPence was in constant contact with Washington on his trip, speaking multiple times to Trump and also to Bolton.

REUTERS\/Maxim Shemetov\/File Photo\n\nThe threat of more sanctions had already made investors wary of Russian companies, seen as more vulnerable to U.S. action than the sovereign. Their fears proved justified when on April 6, the U.S. Treasury slapped sanctions on a range of Russian companies and \u201coligarchs\u201d \u2014 businessmen deemed to be close to the Kremlin.\n\nAluminum company Rusal, controlled by Oleg Deripaska, has been one of the main targets. Rusal itself has warned that the impact of sanctions could trigger technical default on some of its debts.\n\nEarlier sanctions on major Russian companies were so-called sectoral sanctions which limit U.S. investor participation in debt-raising for sanctioned firms. The sanctions imposed on Rusal this month go further, barring U.S. investors from having any dealings with the sanctioned entities.\n\nRussia\u2019s sovereign debt and assets of other Russian companies are not yet sanctioned but that might change. Washington is looking at new sanctions aimed at Russian companies allegedly dealing with equipment related to chemical weapons in Syria.\n\n\u201cThe question investors have is: who is next? Could you extend Rusal-style sanctions to other companies? Potentially they could,\u201d said Greg Saichin, chief investment officer for emerging market debt at Allianz Global Investors.\n\n\u201cWe know of a number of individuals who are either owners of companies or have stakes in companies, who may be next in line ... There is oligarch risk so we have moved to reduce the Kremlin element in the portfolio,\u201d he added.\n\nA list of 210 wealthy Russians named by the U.S. Treasury in January is widely seen as the place to look for clues. It contained 96 oligarchs, including Vladimir Potanin, co-owner of Norilsk Nickel, metals magnates Alisher Usmanov and Alexei Mordashov and CEOs of two big state-run banks.\n\nJohn Bates, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments, said he had reduced exposure to companies with high \u201coligarch risk\u201d, noting that if sanctions were expanded \u201cwe could be in another quite severe leg down in terms of valuations.\u201d\n\nThe latest U.S. sanctions have caused pain across Russian markets, which were riding high with investors prior to last week\u2019s sell off. Investors\u2019 Russian bond holdings as of end-March would have been around $46 billion, assuming their allocation to Russia was the same as its share in various global bond indexes, data from State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) shows.\n\nCALCULATED RISKS\n\nLast week, as the rouble dropped 6 percent, equities fell 4.6 percent and Russian corporate dollar bond yields surged by an average 100 basis points, those portfolios would have suffered heavy losses.\n\nRatings agency Fitch said the sell-off reflected fears the sanctions list would be extended, possibly to companies that transact with the already designated entities and individuals.\n\nAs a result, investors are not ready yet to pick over the wreckage for bargains.\n\nEven before the meltdown, asset managers had been screening Russian companies to avoid exposure to those already subject to sanctions imposed after Russia\u2019s annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region in 2014.\n\nIronically though, those sanctions made companies\u2019 debt more attractive to some investors. A volatile rouble, government pressure to cut external debt and higher barriers to raising debt on international markets steadily reduced their outstanding debt levels.\n\nRussian companies, excluding banks, have about $270 billion in hard currency debt according to TD Securities, and just $13 billion falls due in 2018. Servicing that will not be a problem \u2014 unless they are hit with sanctions too.\n\nFund managers would have to take a \u201ccalculated risk\u201d on which Russian names to sell, Saichin of Allianz said.\n\n\u201cIf no sanction has been imposed you basically have to sit on it,\u201d he said, noting there were few buyers for the bonds anyway.\n\nMoney managers in general see low sanctions risk for Russian sovereign debt and securities of state-run flagship companies such as Gazprom, which supplies a major part of Europe\u2019s energy, or Sberbank, Russia\u2019s biggest bank.\n\nOthers such as Lukoil or Phosagro, which have kept themselves at arms\u2019 length from the Kremlin, are also considered a safer bet.\n\nMarkets reflect that view \u2014 the bonds of steelmaker Severstal, around 80 percent owned by Alexei Mordashov, were the biggest fallers last week from a list of mining and energy firms, after Rusal and Polyus Gold, Abhishek Kumar, lead investment manager for emerging markets fixed income beta at SSGA, noted.\n\nPolyus is controlled by the family of Suleiman Kerimov who is on the sanctioned individuals list.\n\nBonds in Evraz, Norilsk Nickel, Metalloinvest and steel pipe maker TMK also fell an average 3-5 cents last week, while Lukoil and state firm Rosneftegaz fell the least.\n\n\u201cClearly, the sentiments are against any companies dealing in commodities,\u201d Kumar said.\n\nSteelmaker NLMK is controlled by Vladimir Lisin while TMK is majority-owned by Dmitry Pumpyansky. Neither man is on the list of sanctioned individuals.\n\nAs for Russia\u2019s sovereign debt, most investors are sitting tight, believing Washington will not bar investors from it, even if the U.S. Congress is trying to build support for such a step.\n\nSalman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers said the \u201cmindset\u201d was not to ditch Russian government debt even if the latest sanctions had raised fears the sovereign might be hit.\n\n\u201cWe think that would be highly unlikely. It would be like an act of war,\u201d he said.","12":"BAGHDAD\/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Behind the high concrete walls of Baghdad\u2019s Jewish cemetery, Violette Saul lies at rest under a weathered and cracked tombstone, one of the last memorials to an ancient community that is now all but extinct.\n\nA Jewish holy scroll is seen on display at the Babylonian Jewry Heritage Center in Or Yehuda, Israel, April 16, 2018.

Now their numbers are in single figures. And they are missed.\n\nZiyad al-Bayati, an Iraqi Muslim who looks after the rarely visited graveyard near the East Baghdad neighborhood Sadr City, said his father used to reminisce about an Iraq in which ethnic communities lived together.\n\nIt was a time, Bayati said, that predated the turmoil around Israel\u2019s creation, the wars of later years, and the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein and unleashed years of sectarian bloodshed.\n\n\u201cMy father used to say it was the good times when people lived peacefully side by side,\u2019 said Bayati, 48. \u201cThere is no concern shown for the cemetery, (even if) the culture of people here is to respect the dead and their graves.\u201d\n\nOriginal suitcases used by Jews who immigrated from Iraq to Israel are seen on display at the Babylonian Jewry Heritage Center in Or Yehuda, Israel, April 16, 2018.

Each came with one suitcase, and all had to give up their Iraqi citizenship.\n\nFor one of them, Aharon Ben Hur, memories of Iraq are bitter. Now 84 and the owner of two falafel restaurants in Tel Aviv, he recalled the 1941 Farhud pogrom that killed more than 180 Jews during the Jewish festival of Shavuot. His father and younger brother were among them.\n\n\u201cThey were thrown from the second floor. My father died ten days later and the boy almost immediately. He held him in his hands, and they threw them down 100 stairs. I was saved,\u201d Ben Hur said.\n\nHe left early, in 1951. Some hung on much longer. Emad Levy, 52, was the last of Baghdad\u2019s Jews to immigrate to Israel, in 2010.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\n\u201cWe kept our tradition, the holidays, the synagogue,\u201d he told Reuters during the build-up to Israel\u2019s Independence Day. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the joy you feel here during a holiday, walking down the street where most people are Jewish.\u201d\n\nLevy is among perhaps 600,000 Israelis, out of a population of some 8.8 million, who can claim a measure of Iraqi ancestry, according to the heritage center in the town of Or Yehuda near Tel Aviv.\n\nInside a building built in the style of a traditional two-storey Jewish home in Baghdad, there are displays of religious and cultural artifacts of Jewish life in Iraq through the centuries. Visitors walk through the reconstructed crooked alleys of Baghdad\u2019s Jewish quarter and view a scaled-down replica of the city\u2019s Great Synagogue.\n\nExhibits at the museum depict a hard landing for the Iraqi immigrants in the early years of Israel, where Ashkenazim, or Jews of European descent, were the ruling elite and Sephardim, Jews with roots in the Middle East, faced prejudice.\n\nOne photo shows Iraqi newcomers being sprayed with DDT pesticide. A tent has been erected on the floor, showing how the immigrants were initially housed.\n\nBut it also records how Iraqi Jews have gone on to become generals in the Israeli military, cabinet ministers, legislators, business executives, entertainers and celebrated writers.\n\nFew expect ever to go back, amid the violent turmoil that still envelops Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and other countries which once had thriving Jewish communities.\n\nNow aged 90, Zevulun Hareli joined a Jewish self-defense underground movement in Iraq, and recalls the fate of some of his fellow Zionists in 1948.\n\n\u201cThey were children, 14 or 15. They were tortured. They were hanged. Their genitals were burned,\u201d said Hareli, who immigrated to Israel in 1949. \u201cIraq said Zionism is a crime.\u201d\n\nSome still harbor more positive sentiments. Edwin Shuker, who was born in Iraq, has made several visits to the Baghdad cemetery in recent years, sometimes bringing people who want to say Kaddish - the Jewish prayer for the dead - over the graves.\n\nHe says he is welcomed by Iraqis when he goes back, and encounters nostalgia for a time when Iraq included a \u201cmosaic\u201d of minorities.\n\n\u201cNo-one is going to move back,\u201d concedes Shuker, 62, who had to escape Iraq in 1971. \u201cHowever there are many who would be very receptive to visiting their shrines and where there ancestors are buried.

The strikes don\u2019t alter that reality,\u201d Ross said.\n\nRussia has declared victory three times in Syria and thwarted international efforts for a political transition and Assad\u2019s eventual departure, said Maksad.\n\n\u201cPutin has the political will and the endurance to stay the course in Syria and he has demonstrated that for almost three years,\u201d Maksad said."},"URL":{"0":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria\/opcw-experts-unlikely-to-enter-douma-on-wednesday-u-n-source-idUSKBN1HP0SG","1":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-israel-iran\/israel-hints-it-could-hit-irans-air-force-in-syria-idUSKBN1HO2DT","2":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-usa\/after-chemical-weapons-attack-trump-quickly-changed-tune-on-syria-idUSKBN1HL08I","3":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-un-guterres\/u-n-chief-urges-restraint-avoid-escalation-in-syria-idUSKBN1HL10X","4":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-trump\/trump-mission-accomplished-on-perfectly-executed-syria-strike-idUSKBN1HL0TW","5":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-un-vote\/u-n-security-council-fails-to-adopt-russian-resolution-on-syria-idUSKBN1HL162","6":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-prisoner\/man-linked-to-9-11-attacks-on-u-s-captured-in-syria-pentagon-idUSKBN1HR027","7":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria\/western-powers-to-study-options-if-syria-chemical-weapons-used-again-uk-idUSKBN1HM0BK","8":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-france\/france-says-its-analysis-points-to-syria-behind-douma-gas-attack-idUSKBN1HL0OU","9":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-un-usa\/if-syria-uses-toxic-gas-again-u-s-locked-and-loaded-u-n-envoy-haley-idUSKBN1HL121","10":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-turkey-security-usa\/u-s-pastor-held-in-turkey-for-his-christian-faith-lawyer-says-idUSKBN1HM0OO","11":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-russia-sanctions-funds-analysis\/whos-next-investors-seek-to-purge-oligarch-risk-from-russia-portfolios-idUSKBN1HO2O0","12":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-israel-independence-iraq-jews\/with-jews-largely-gone-from-iraq-memories-survive-in-israel-idUSKBN1HP1ID","13":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-iran-guards\/iran-guards-warn-of-fallout-for-u-s-of-syria-attacks-fars-idUSKBN1HL0DO","14":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-airport\/pro-iranian-hezbollah-says-missiles-intercepted-over-syrias-dumair-military-airport-idUSKBN1HN34Q","15":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-eu\/eu-cool-to-u-s-plan-for-new-russia-sanctions-over-syria-idUSKBN1HN16P","16":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-putin\/russia-calls-for-un-meeting-on-syria-mulls-supplies-of-s-300-systems-idUSKBN1HL0GV","17":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-douma\/in-damascuss-ravaged-farm-belt-doumas-residents-jostle-for-loaves-idUSKBN1HN2BD","18":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-netherlands\/u-n-security-council-should-keep-pushing-for-syria-ceasefire-dutch-minister-idUSKBN1HN0OC","19":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-mideast-crisis-syria-strategy\/despite-trumps-mission-accomplished-question-raised-over-u-s-syria-strategy-idUSKBN1HL17X"}}
