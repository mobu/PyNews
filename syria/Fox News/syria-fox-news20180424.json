Authorities identified the suspected driver as Alek Minassian, 25, of Richmond Hill, north of Toronto, police said. Minassian is accused of driving into dozens of people intentionally in a chaotic, deadly scene in Toronto. \"We don\u2019t rule out anything,\" Toronto Police Service Chief Mark Saunders said in a Monday evening news conference. \"We need to follow what we have. \"Based on witness accounts, it\u2019s very clear the actions definitely looked deliberate,\" Saunders said. He said Minassian had not been known to police previously.\n\n'It was a nightmare': Witness recounts Toronto van crash\n\nCLOSE CALL FOR POMPEO: Mike Pompeo, President Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of state, barely avoided a rare rebuke from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after unexpected last-minute drama ... The panel had deadlocked on a party-line vote after Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, who had been expected to vote for Pompeo, missed the committee meeting because of a funeral. But the committee then voted favorably on his nomination after Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, who opposes Pompeo, agreed to vote \"present\" instead of \"no\" because of Isakson's situation. The final tally was 11 to 9 with 1 present. Isakson was allowed to vote by proxy in this particular case. Despite the committee drama, Pompeo still appears poised to secure the necessary 51 votes for confirmation from the entire Senate, with three red-state Democrats also saying they will support him.\n\nNEW HEALTH SCARE FOR GEORGE H.W. BUSH: Former President George H.W. Bush was hospitalized on Sunday, one day after the funeral for his wife, former first lady Barbara Bush, for an infection he contracted that spread to his blood, his spokesman said ... \"President Bush was admitted to Houston Methodist Hospital yesterday morning after contracting an infection that spread to his blood,\" spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement. \"He is responding to treatments and appears to be recovering. We will issue additional updates as events warrant.\" Barbara Bush died on April 17 at the age of 92, shortly after her family announced she was in failing health and would decline further medical treatment in favor of \"comfort care.\" The former president was hospitalized twice last year for pneumonia.\n\n'CARAVAN' WARNED: Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen warned the \u201ccaravan\u201d of Central American migrants arriving at the southern U.S. border that they could face prosecution, detention and deportation, as President Trump called on the agency to block the group ... The announcement came as a group of about 50 migrants who left southern Mexico in March reportedly reached the U.S. border, planning to seek asylum. \u201cDHS continues to monitor the remnants of the \u2018caravan\u2019 of individuals headed to our Southern border with the apparent intention of entering the United States illegally,\u201d Nielsen said in a statement. \u201cA sovereign nation that cannot\u2014or worse, chooses not\u2014to defend its borders will soon cease to be a sovereign nation. The Trump administration is committed to enforcing our immigration laws \u2013 whether persons are part of this \u2018caravan\u2019 or not.\u201d\n\n'Caravans' and refugees: What to know\n\nCOSBY JURY WILL SOON DECIDE: The jury that will start deliberating Bill Cosby's fate on Tuesday has heard the comedian described over the past two weeks both as a \"serial rapist\" and a con artist's victim ... They have seen a parade of accusers testify that the man once revered as \"America's Dad\" had a secret life of drugging and violating women. And they have heard from a witness who says his chief accuser talked about framing a high-profile person to score a big payday. Now, seven men and five women who have been kept in a suburban Philadelphia hotel, away from family, friends and daily routines, will get to have their say in the first big celebrity trial of the #MeToo era.

Some of the protesters have attacked Israel\u2019s border security fence \u201cwith explosives, firebombs and other means,\u201d The Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cHuge plumes of smoke from burning tires (set afire by demonstrators) engulfed the border area,\u201d the AP reported from the scene. \u201cSome of the activists` threw stones toward the fence or flew kites with flaming rags dangling from their tails.\u201d\n\nIn other words, what\u2019s happening on the Gaza-Israel border is not a peaceful protest. While most protesters aren\u2019t joining in the violence, some are violent and dangerous terrorists who want to tear down Israel\u2019s security fence to make it easy to launch deadly attacks on the Jewish state.\n\nActing to defend their nation, Israeli forces have killed 34 Palestinian attackers along the border since the protests began March 30, despite the best efforts by the Israelis to use the minimal force required.\n\nNo nation on Earth would welcome terrorist murderers to cross its borders to take the lives of innocent civilians. And if terrorists assaulted any other border on the planet, the number of attackers killed would undoubtedly be much higher.\n\nThe protests are scheduled to end with a massive Palestinian march on the border May 15, the 70th anniversary (on the secular calendar) of Israel gaining independence from Britain.\n\nYou might think the United Nations and countries around the world would be condemning the violent protests \u2013 but you\u2019d be wrong. Israel\u2019s s actions to defend its border prompted the usual Israel-bashing at the U.N., in the media, and wherever left gathers to condemn the only democracy in the Middle East.\n\nIt\u2019s tragic that violence is a daily fact of life in much of the Middle East, including Israel and the Palestinian territories.\n\nWhen you speak to Israelis and Palestinians who aren\u2019t involved in the politics of the region \u2013 as I did on my recent visit to Israel \u2013 one fact stands out: they all want peace. They\u2019re weary of the costs of war and they\u2019re sick of seeing their children fighting and dying in a never-ending battle that benefits no one.\n\nAn Israeli woman told me that Palestinian women taking part in nascent peace movements have had their lives and the lives of their families threatened if they continued to campaign for peace.\n\nThe average Gaza resident hardly desires to spend Friday afternoons burning tires and risking getting shot or killed. But as long as Hamas calls the shots, some are drawn to violence.\n\nWhat the Palestinians and their supporters around the globe fail to acknowledge is that the true oppressor of Palestinians in Gaza is not Israel, which completely withdrew from the territory in 2005. The real oppressor of Palestinians is Hamas itself.\n\nHamas\u2019 obstructionist policy of non-recognition of Israel \u2013 and its vow to destroy Israel as Jewish state \u2013 is not just empty rhetoric. The terrorist group regularly launches rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and spends millions of dollars building cross-border tunnels for terrorists to infiltrate Israel.\n\nHamas refuses to cooperate with the Palestinian Authority and has created a humanitarian nightmare for the innocent people trapped under its sway. Electricity is available only a few hours a day, tap water is undrinkable, unemployment stands at 50 percent, the Mediterranean shoreline is contaminated, and only humanitarian aid from Israel sustains the lives of Gaza residents.\n\nBut you would never glean any of that from the latest round of headlines condemning Israel for using \u201cdisproportionate\u201d force against civilians. As if Israelis were obligated to let themselves be killed by terrorists to make sure as many of them died as Palestinians to achieve proportionality.\n\nThe reality is that the masses of Palestinians remaining a safe distance from the border are a cover for the armed terrorists seeking to crash through the fence each Friday and attack Israeli communities less than a mile from Gaza.\n\nThis explains Hamas\u2019 resort to burning tires and flying kites with flaming tails \u2013 the thick black smoke is intended to offer cover to the infiltrators. Yet the quotes reporters gather from the protesters never offer the same rationale twice for the demonstrations, because in fact there is no rationale for them, other than Hamas seeking to save itself from irrelevancy.\n\nIn today\u2019s Middle East, the game has changed. It\u2019s no longer a battle between Israelis and Palestinians, fought at the negotiating table as well as through individual acts of violence against Israeli civilians.\n\nInstead, the real story is how united former enemies \u2013 Israel, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, Jordan, and Egypt \u2013 have become in the face of existential threats from Iran and ISIS.\n\nMany Palestinians have been all but abandoned by their \u201cprotectors,\u201d no longer a pawn in the greater game of wiping Israel off the map.\n\nAnd Arab nations have quietly drawn together with Israel to find ways to stop Iran and its proxies \u2013 the terrorist groups Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and ISIS \u2013 from taking control of even more of the Middle East, now that Syria, Lebanon, and to a growing extent Iraq are under Iran\u2019s sway.\n\nAs a result, Hamas is facing tough times. The terrorist group\u2019s rejection of Israel no longer has relevance for leaders across the Middle East who now have Iran and ISIS to worry about.\n\nSo Hamas has seized on Land Day, a four decade-old Palestinian grievance against Israel, as the excuse for launching a series of raids on the Jewish state. These raids are masked by the mass demonstrations intended to culminate on Israel\u2019s 70th anniversary, the day the U.S. Embassy moves to Jerusalem. But you would never know any of that from the left-wing, Israel-bashing media or the enemies of freedom at the United Nations.\n\nThe number of Gaza protesters actually declined from the first week to the second, for several reasons. First, the people of Gaza \u2013 whose lives have been broken by the Hamas leadership ostensibly \u201cserving\u201d them \u2013 have bigger fish to fry than the question of where exactly American visas will be processed in the Jewish state once the new embassy opens its doors.\n\nAnd second, Gaza residents have to recognize that despite Hamas propaganda, their bleak situation can no longer be blamed on Israel, which is in fact the source of humanitarian shipments of food, water and medicine. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, they\u2019ve come to see that Hamas isn\u2019t the solution to the problem; Hamas is the problem.\n\nThis Friday, Hamas will be sponsoring yet another protest at the border. Here\u2019s hoping that Gazans will rise up \u2013 not against their so-called oppressors in Israel but against the real force that has relegated their lives to nightmare status. And that would be Hamas itself.","2":"","3":"","4":"","5":"","6":"Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nA mass shooting at a Waffle House is raising more questions about the issues of gun possession and mental health.

FOX's Foreign Affairs Correspondent, Benjamin Hall, reported from the Syrian border after the gas attacks in early April. He describes his experience and the people he met along the way.\n\nPlus, a commentary by FOX News Contributor Jessica Tarlov.","7":"The Russian military has indicated it will supply the Syrian government with a sophisticated air defense system, after condemning a missile attack launched by the U.S., Britain and France earlier this month.\n\nCol. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi said in a statement Wednesday that Russia will supply Syria with \"new missile defense systems soon.\" Rudskoi did not specify the type of weapons, but his remarks follow reports in the Russian media that Moscow is considering selling its S-300 surface-to-air missile systems to Syria.\n\nTop Russian officials said earlier this month that Moscow may reconsider a pledge it gave a decade ago not to provide Syria with the S-300 system in light of the airstrikes on Syria earlier this month.\n\nRussia is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad.","8":"next\n\nprev\n\nInternational efforts to rebuild Syria once the civil war is over should center on agriculture to kick start the economy and quickly improve the livelihoods of the people, a high-level United Nations official said Tuesday.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press ahead of an international Syria donors conference, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization's Deputy Director General Daniel Gustafson said that in case of a return to peace the impact of funding farming would yield almost immediate results.\n\n\"If you invest in that, you are going to get a quick return,\" he said.\n\nDespite seven years of warfare through much of the Middle Eastern nation which also blighted farmland and destroyed facilities, farming still accounts for about a quarter of Syria's gross domestic product.\n\nUN figures show that some $16 billion in production has been lost because of the war and it will take about as much to get the recovery of farming going again. At the two-day Syria conference opening Tuesday, donors from across the globe hope to commit several billion in assistance to alleviate the pressing needs of Syrians. Over $5 billion was committed last year.\n\nFarming in Syria goes back many thousands of years and the nation was long a breadbasket for the area. When the war started almost half the population was still employed in farming.\n\nAnd despite the horrific war that ravaged orchards and fields, cut the availability of seeds and fertilizers and sent many millions fleeing, half the output survives to this day.\n\n\"The resilience of the agriculture sector is an astonishing story. You still have half the production of wheat of what you had before the war\" \u2014 two million tons, instead of 4 million before the war, Gustafson said.\n\nStill, some 6.5 million people are in urgent need of immediate assistance because they face a lack of food, said Gustafson.\n\nWhile most of the attention goes to shocking events like bombings or even gas attacks, war in the countryside often has a more creeping effect.\n\n\"It is this continuous deterioration of their livelihoods. You cannot get seeds, you cannot sell stuff, you cannot trade, you cannot get spare parts,\" Gustafson said. \"The whole thing just kind of grinds down.\"\n\nHe said that fortunately, the situation can also pick up again soon once the conditions are right, once the right seeds come in again and people and goods are again free to move around the country.","9":"next\n\nprev\n\nEU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini is calling on Russia, Iran and Turkey to force a halt to fighting in Syria, as international donors gather in Brussels to drum up aid for the conflict-ravaged country.\n\nMogherini told reporters Wednesday that the three have a \"special responsibility\" to ensure the conditions for a cease-fire and to pressure Syrian President Bashar Assad to return to the negotiating table.\n\n\"We are seeing an escalation in military activities which is exactly the contrary\" to what they promised to work toward, she said.\n\nAround 80 countries, organizations and partners backing Syria are taking part in the donor conference in Brussels.\n\nOrganizers hope the meeting will give impetus to stalled peace moves under U.N. auspices, on top of gathering several billion dollars in humanitarian aid.","10":"With exaggerated handshakes and a pair of kisses, President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron professed a sunny, best-friends relationship Tuesday, even as the two allies strained to bridge differences over the Iran nuclear agreement, Syria and more.\n\nHosting Macron for the first state visit of his administration, culminating in a lavish dinner Tuesday night, Trump remained firm in his criticism of past and enduring American undertakings in Iran and elsewhere in the Middle East. But he appeared open to the French president's pleas to maintain U.S. involvement in Syria \u2014 and expressed openness to negotiating a new agreement with Iran.\n\nAs Trump weighs withdrawing the U.S. from the Iran nuclear accord, he issued a warning to Iran against restarting its nuclear program, saying, \"They will have bigger problems than they've ever had before.\"\n\nAt a joint White House news conference, he appeared to be more in line with Macron's push for a longer-term U.S. presence in Syria. Trump, who announced weeks ago that he would withdraw American troops, said Macron reinforced the idea of a potential Iranian takeover of territory liberated from the Islamic State group.\n\n\"We'll be coming home,\" Trump said, \"but we want to leave a strong and lasting footprint.\"\n\nMacron told Trump that together the U.S. and France would defeat terrorism, curtail weapons of mass destruction in North Korea and Iran, and act together on behalf of the planet. That last point was a reference to Macron's work to revive the U.S. role in the Paris climate accord to fight global warming, another international agreement Trump has spurned.\n\nDifferences aside, Trump and Macron lavished praise \u2014 and even a pair of kisses \u2014 on each other Tuesday.\n\n\"It's an honor to call you my friend,\" Trump said, after predicting Macron would be a historic leader of France.\n\nIn one light moment, Trump sought to demonstrate some of the personal chemistry he claimed. The U.S. president brushed something off Macron's suit jacket, saying, \"We have a very special relationship; in fact, I'll get that little piece of dandruff off. We have to make him perfect \u2014 he is perfect.\"\n\nThe meetings followed a pomp-filled welcome ceremony on the South Lawn. Highlights included a 21-gun salute and Melania Trump's wide-brim white hat, which drew more comments than all the rest of the pageantry.\n\nTrump said before an audience of U.S. soldiers and members of his Cabinet that the relationship he forged with Macron at the start of his presidency was a testament to the \"enduring friendship that binds our two nations.\" He thanked the French leader for his \"steadfast partnership\" in the recent missile strike in response to the chemical attack in Syria.\n\nMacron said, \"History is calling us. It is urging our people to find the fortitude that has guided us in the most difficult of times. France and with it, Europe, and the United States have an appointment with history.\" Later he placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nThe social highlight of Macron's visit was Tuesday night's formal state dinner at the White House. More than 130 guests dined on rack of lamb and nectarine tart and enjoyed an after-dinner performance by the Washington National Opera. The previous evening, the leaders and their wives took a helicopter tour of Washington landmarks and had dinner at the Potomac River home of George Washington in Mount Vernon, Virginia.\n\nAs he gave a toast at the dinner, Trump hailed the bonds between the U.S. and France, saying, \"May our friendship grow even deeper, may our kinship grow even stronger and may our sacred liberty never die.\"\n\nAs for substantive issues, one of Macron's main objectives during his three-day visit to Washington was to persuade Trump to stay in the Iran accord, which is aimed at restricting Iran's development of nuclear weapons. Trump is skeptical of the pact's effectiveness \u2014 \"it's insane, it's ridiculous,\" he said Tuesday \u2014 but he declined to say whether he would withdraw the U.S. by the May 12 deadline he has set.\n\nHe reminded his French counterpart of what he sees as flaws in the agreement, which he said fails to address ballistic missiles or Iran's activities in Yemen or Syria.\n\nMeanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned that pulling out would undermine America's upcoming nuclear talks with North Korea by proving the U.S. reneges on its promises.\n\nHe told The Associated Press in an interview in New York that if Trump withdraws, Iran would \"most likely\" abandon the deal as well and would no longer be bound by its international obligations. That would free Iran to resume enrichment activity beyond the limits imposed by the 2015 accord.\n\nMacron told reporters that he and Trump would look at the Iran deal \"in a wider regional context,\" taking into account the situation in Syria. \"We have a common objective, we want to make sure there's no escalation and no nuclear proliferation in the region. We now need to find the right path forward,\" Macron said.\n\nTrump suggested he was open to \"doing something\" beyond the current Iran agreement as long as it was done \"strongly.\"\n\nOn North Korea, Trump told Macron that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wanted to meet \"as soon as possible.\" The president, who once derided Kim as \"Little Rocket Man,\" said he has been \"very open\" and \"very honorable\" so far.\n\nMacron, who calls Trump often, has emerged as something of a \"Trump whisperer\" at a time when the American president's relationships with other European leaders are more strained. Trump, who attaches great importance to the optics of pageantry and ceremony, chose to honor Macron with the first state visit of his administration as he woos the French president.\n\nTrump ended his first year in office without receiving a foreign leader on a state visit, the first president in nearly 100 years to fail to do so. He was Macron's guest last July at the annual Bastille Day military parade in Paris. Macron and his wife, Brigitte, also took Trump and his wife on a tour of Napoleon's tomb and whisked them up in the Eiffel Tower for dinner overlooking the City of Light.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Ken Thomas and Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/dsupervilleap"},"URL":{"0":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2018\/04\/24\/fox-news-first-terrorism-not-ruled-out-in-deadly-toronto-van-crash-homeland-security-warns-caravan.html","1":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/2018\/04\/25\/in-gaza-hamas-is-oppressor-not-israel.html","2":"http:\/\/video.foxnews.com\/v\/5775670343001\/","3":"http:\/\/video.foxnews.com\/v\/5775654448001\/","4":"http:\/\/video.foxnews.com\/v\/5776324346001\/","5":"http:\/\/video.foxnews.com\/v\/5775972134001\/","6":"https:\/\/radio.foxnews.com\/2018\/04\/24\/the-fox-news-rundown-4-24-2018\/","7":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/world\/2018\/04\/25\/russia-hints-it-may-provide-advanced-air-defenses-to-syria.html","8":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/world\/2018\/04\/24\/un-says-farming-should-be-at-heart-syria-reconstruction.html","9":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/world\/2018\/04\/25\/eu-urge-russia-iran-turkey-to-deliver-on-syria-promises.html","10":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2018\/04\/24\/trump-warns-iran-will-pay-if-it-restarts-nuclear-program.html"}}
