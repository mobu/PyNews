So, I ordered the French armed forces to intervene tonight, as part of an international operation in coalition with the United States of America and the United Kingdom and directed against the clandestine chemical arsenal of the Syrian regime.\"\n\nWhat was hit?\n\nThree sites were targeted, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters:\n\nA scientific research center in Damascus;\n\nA chemical weapons storage facility, located west of Homs;\n\nAnd a chemical weapons equipment storage facility and command post near Homs.\n\nIn an update Saturday, Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said the strikes \"successfully hit every target\" and that the allies \"took every measure and caution\" to hit only the intended targets.\n\n\"We met our objectives. We hit the sites, the heart of the chemical weapons program. So, it was mission accomplished,\" she said.\n\nLt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, director of the Joint Staff, said that none of the aircraft or missiles involved in this operation were successfully engaged by Syrian air defenses. There was no indication that Russian air defenses were deployed, he added.\n\nSyria and its military backer, Russia, gave a different assessment.\n\nRussian Army Colonel General Sergey Rudskoy told reporters that Syria's air defense systems intercepted 71 out of 103 cruise missiles Russia believes were fired by the Western allies.\n\nAccording to preliminary reports, there were no civilian casualties or losses from the Syrian army, Rudskoy said.

President Trump\n\nPresident Trump thinks he can do great things in a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But he's also more than willing to walk away . Speaking at Mar-a-Lago with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the President said that if talks with Kim aren't \"fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting.\" Abe during the visit reminded Trump about past US failures in North Korean interactions.\n\nMeantime, Trump downplayed talk he's getting ready to fire special counsel Robert Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein; \"They're still here,\" he said. When questions turned to Russia, he used his go-to phrase -- \"no collusion\" -- FIVE times . Speaking of Russia, senior administration officials told CNN the President personally made the decision to dump the plan to hit the Russians with more sanctions after the Syria chemical weapons attack. Trump also is facing backlash for using the word \"breeding\" when discussing cities that don't cooperate with the feds to deport undocumented immigrants.\n\n2. Puerto Rico blackout\n\nPuerto Rico just can't catch a break. Almost the entire island is in the dark this morning, after a crew removing a fallen tower got too close to an energized line, causing it to fail and, in the process, knock out power across the grid. Only a fraction of residents have regained power so far. This is the second blackout in two weeks caused by the same subcontractor, so the island's governor wants its public power agency to cancel its contract. Huge swaths of Puerto Rico have been without power since Hurricane Maria destroyed its electrical grid last fall, making that the second-longest blackout in history\n\n3. Cuba\n\nThe man likely to become Cuba's next President may not carry the Castro name, but he'll uphold the Castro ideology. Cuban First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel was nominated by the country's National Assembly to replace Raul Castro as the island nation's leader. He's a 57-year-old technocrat who said he believes \"in continuity,\" dashing the hopes of those wishing that a change in leadership could lead to reforms. And Raul Castro is still expected to exercise a large measure of control over the Cuban government.\n\nJUST WATCHED The challenges facing Cuba's likely new leader Replay More Videos ...

And that's concerning because there's fear all the physical evidence of an attack might be gone by the time a team gets in. About 75 people were killed in the attack, for which Syria and Russia were blamed.

After Friday night's strikes against regime targets in Syria , he's demanding a concerted drive to resurrect the international peace process, last seen late in 2016. Whether anyone listens may decide if Syria turns the corner towards peace or descends into an even more dangerous cycle of destruction.\n\nThe strikes themselves were not about regime change or forcing Assad to negotiate, but about deterring the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime, which remains free to kill Syrians with conventional methods.\n\nAs David Miliband, the CEO of the International Rescue Committee, puts it, the strikes \"will become a historical footnote unless they are matched by a diplomatic offensive of sustained and serious character.\"\n\nSpeaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, Macron said the priority must be to \"initiate negotiations as soon as possible on a credible and inclusive political process,\" according to a statement from the Elysee Palace. It was a message he repeated after the strikes to US President Donald Trump and the Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nMaybe the barest bones of such preparation are beginning to emerge. The US, UK and France, supported by Germany, agree that Syria's chemical weapons must be destroyed once and for all; there must be an immediate ceasefire; and that the Syrian regime has to accept a \"substantial agenda' at the UN Geneva talks that would lead to what the French UN ambassador, Fran\u00e7ois Delattre, calls an 'inclusive political solution.'\n\nBare bones indeed, and there won't be immediate progress in the current atmosphere. There are also plenty of headwinds.\n\nThe US and Russia\n\nFor any sort of diplomacy to occur, the downward spiral of US-Russia relations needs to be arrested. In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said there were \"multiple issues we have with Russia right now;\" and she said more sanctions were coming this week.\n\nOn a whole range of issues, from arms control to the mutual expulsions of diplomats after the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK and the issue of Russian meddling in the 2016 election campaign, relations are at their worst for decades. The tough sanctions imposed by Washington against members of Putin's inner circle this month have compounded the crisis.\n\nJUST WATCHED Russia reacts to Trump's Syria strike tweets Replay More Videos ...

Shortly before he was fired, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson set aside $200 million to stabilize northern Syria, where Kurdish-led militias who defeated ISIS are supported by some 2,000 US troops. There were plans to build a 30,000-strong border protection force. (Tillerson's speech, the only expression of the Trump Administration's policy towards Syria, has now been 'archived' on the State Department website .)\n\nPresident Trump then froze the $200 million and said he wanted US forces out of northern Syria \"very soon. Let the other people take care of it now,\" he told a rally in March.\n\nJUST WATCHED Meet the key players in Syria's civil war Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Meet the key players in Syria's civil war 02:22\n\nBut a unilateral US withdrawal would leave the Kurds vulnerable to the regime, the Iranians and the Turks; ISIS remnants will sniff out opportunities in the chaos.\n\nOther US officials, including Haley, have tried to temper talk of a withdrawal, but Assad may conclude that if he waits long enough, the US will lose interest. After all, Trump said on Friday: \"No amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East.\"\n\nThere are certainly no signs that the regime is ready to discuss anything that would challenge Assad's hold on power. And so the political opposition won't come to the table.\n\nTurkey eyes opportunities\n\nTurkey may be part of the \"triad\" with Iran and Russia but is very much going its own way in northern Syria, consolidating its influence into a chunky bargaining chip for the future. Its troops already occupy Afrin, a mixed Kurdish-Arab area and it is eyeing further incursions against the Kurdish militia -- the YPG -- that has worked with the US against ISIS. President Erdogan has said he will not rest until the YPG are driven from every part of the Syrian border.\n\nTurkish forces, much to the Assad regime's fury, are also in Idlib -- ostensibly to guard a mythical de-confliction zone, but in reality to deter the regime from attacking the last rebel holdouts.\n\nIran at the gates\n\nThe Iranian \"Quds\" force has spent some four years entrenching itself in Syria. Try getting it to leave. The dream of The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (of which the Quds is part) is a land bridge of Shia influence from Tehran to the shores of the Mediterranean, and within shooting range of Israel.\n\nResponding to the weekend strikes the IRGC promised the United States that future events in the region \"will not be to their interest.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Iran fires missiles into Syria Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Iran fires missiles into Syria 03:06\n\nTo Israel, the growing presence of the IRGC and Hezbollah in southern Syria is alarming. It has already carried out air-strikes against several Iran-linked targets in Syria, including the base near Homs which likely sent an armed drone into Israeli airspace in February. In response, the leader of the Lebanese Shia militia Hezbollah, closely aligned with Iran, warned that Israel had made a \"historic mistake\" which would bring the it \"into direct combat with the Iranians.\"\n\nUnless Russia can be persuaded to restrain the IRGC and even send some of its militia home, there is a real chance that Israel will get dragged much more deeply into the Syrian conflict.\n\nThe next slaughter\n\nThen there is the Assad regime's determination to recover more of Syrian territory, specifically Idlib, the last hold-out of radical Islamist groups but also home to two million Syrians, more than half of them displaced from other parts of the country.\n\nAli Akbar Velayati, an advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in Damascus last week that the liberation of Idlib is the next target of the \"resistance front.\"\n\nOn Sunday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian said Idlib could become the next humanitarian disaster. \"Idlib's fate must be settled by a political process,\" he told Le Journal du Dimanche.\n\nWithout a revived peace process, Syria's war will be refueled by all these competing (non-Syrian) interests. More than ever it will be a sandbox for a battle among outside powers.\n\nSlithers of hope\n\nWhat incentives are there to forestall the next episode of Syria's nightmare? Firstly, Russia doesn't want to be saddled propping up a broken state and hasn't the resources to embark on its reconstruction. Nor does it want to get caught up in a hot war between Israel and Iran.\n\nAssad, at some point, will want to restore sovereignty over the 20% of Syrian territory controlled by the Kurds (with at the moment US support.)\n\nIn Moscow, Paris and Washington there is also recognition that a deterioration in Syria will provide ISIS and other jihadi groups with fresh opportunities, and maybe spark another refugee exodus.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump's message to Iran and Russia Replay More Videos ...

Democrat Senator Tim Kaine said Sunday: \"They haven't laid out a strategy, and military action shouldn't be taken as a one-off.\"\n\nWhether Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State and John Bolton as National Security Adviser bring clarity to US policy remains to be seen. Their previous pronouncements suggest they will want a hard line against both Russia and Iran.\n\nBut all roads to Damascus go through Moscow. Can Vladimir Putin be persuaded to prod Assad towards meaningful negotiations and persuade the Iranians to cool it? Might he coax Turkey into leaving northern Syria, and under what conditions? And what might he want in return?","11":"(CNN) The United States, the United Kingdom and France are pushing for an \"irreversible\" end to Syria's chemical weapons program, amid furious recriminations from Russia over the effectiveness and legality of a wave of US-led missile strikes on Syrian targets.\n\nUN diplomats shared with CNN a new resolution, led by France and backed by the United States and the United Kingdom, calling for an independent investigation into the suspected chemical weapons attack inside Syria that precipitated the cruise missile strikes unleashed by the Western allies on Friday.\n\nFrance's ambassador to the United Nations, Francois Delattre, said Syria's chemical weapons program must be dismantled in a \"verifiable and irreversible way.\"\n\nThe renewed push for a UN-backed diplomatic solution follows a volatile emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, called by Moscow on Saturday, with Russia's UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, condemning the joint US-British-French strikes as a violation of international law.\n\nNebenzia said Friday's missile strikes, targeted at facilities associated with the Syrian regime's chemical weapons program, had been a \"blow to the political settlement\" in the divided Middle Eastern nation.\n\nThe Russian-led response to the strikes, though limited to words, comes amid days of building pressure and talk among UN diplomats of a potential new Cold War.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged all Security Council members to show restraint, as US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley told the meeting that Washington remains \"locked and loaded\" to respond to any future Syrian chemical attacks.\n\nOutside the UN, protests against the strikes were held around the world Saturday, including in major cities in the United States, Mexico, Greece and the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile some of the protesters came out in support of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad's regime, many others were opposed to the use of military action by Western powers against Syria.\n\nNew chemical weapons resolution\n\nInvestigators from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, arrived in Syria on Saturday to begin their investigation into the alleged chemical attack in the Syrian city of Douma.\n\nThe team met with Syrian authorities in Damascus at 7 p.m. local time on Saturday, according to Syrian Ambassador to the UN Bashar Jaafari.\n\nIt was the suspected chemical attack that led the Western allies to order the missile strikes, which they lay squarely at the feet of the Syrian regime.\n\nSenior US officials said on Saturday they were confident both chlorine and sarin gas were used in the attack. Both the Syrian and Russian governments have denied Damascus' involvement in the attack.\n\nThe new French-led resolution presented to the Security Council would have investigators from the OPCW report their findings to the UN within a new timetable.\n\nA Security Council diplomat told CNN there was no rush to vote on the draft resolution, but an attempt will be made to engage in serious negotiations.\n\nThe resolution would also allow a third-party review of humanitarian evacuations from Douma and medical evacuations with no conditions.\n\nJUST WATCHED Amanpour: Ball is in Syrian allies' court Replay More Videos ...

Satterfield, the State Department's acting assistant secretary for the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs told lawmakers on Wednesday.\n\n\"Therefore, we are reaching out to partners across the region to see what form of contribution -- and not just financial -- they may make to sustaining this fight beyond the destruction of ISIS,\" Satterfield said during a hearing before the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nSpecifically, the US is pursuing contributions from Egypt, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to help counter Iran in Syria by filling the void should the US significantly reduce its footprint in the country.\n\nWhile Trump's decision to launch missile strikes against alleged chemical weapons facilities belonging to the Syrian regime has amplified the debate over the administration's long-term goals, the move has not derailed efforts to convince other nations to take on a larger role going forward.\n\nA source close to the White House told CNN on Tuesday that despite initial concerns that Trump would withdraw from Syria in the very near term, discussions have shifted toward developing a transition plan and that the administration is continuing its push to enlist the help of several Arab nations including Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt.\n\nThis source also confirmed that Bolton recently called Egypt's acting intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel, to gauge whether his country would be willing to contribute to the effort, a detail previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nCNN reported earlier this month that the White House was pushing for a deal with Saudi Arabia and members of the Gulf Cooperation Council that would allow Trump to reduce the number of US troops in Syria but also address the laundry list of concerns expressed by top military officials who cautioned against a hasty withdrawal.\n\nA source familiar with the internal discussions told CNN at the time that the White House has been seeking additional assistance from Saudi Arabia, which the administration has worked to convince to send money and troops.\n\nSaudi Arabia's foreign minister, Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir, said Tuesday that Saudi Arabia is engaged in talks with the US and would consider sending forces to Syria along with other Arab countries as part of this contingent.\n\nJubeir also noted that the idea is not necessarily new, as Saudi Arabia made a similar proposal to the Obama administration, but that the US did not take them up on the offer.\n\nWhere do things stand?\n\nWhile the Trump administration remains engaged in talks with some Arab nations about the possibility of building some sort of a regional coalition, it appears that a formal agreement has not been reached at this point.\n\nCoalition spokesperson Col. Ryan Dillon said Tuesday that individual nations are responsible for announcing specific force contributions on the ground in Syria.\n\n\"As far as the coalition and individual nations that are contributing forces to Syria as a request by those nations we have not announced that and we will respect their request on that, so whether that's providing air support or ground support or trainers, we'll leave that to individual nations to personally make that announcement,\" he said.\n\nStill, top members of Trump's national security team -- including Bolton and Pompeo -- have indicated that they support the proposal.\n\nSpecifically, Pompeo has expressed interest in the concept of an Arab coalition since he first joined the Trump administration as CIA director and his informal advisers met with Egyptian officials even before his nomination for Secretary of State was announced.\n\nBut while nations like Saudi Arabia have indicated that progress could be possible, the US has yet to determine what is it willing to offer in exchange for participation.\n\nAccording to a source with knowledge of the situation, one idea that is currently being discussed within the National Security Council -- and is in play at this time -- is to offer the Saudis major non-NATO status if they were to come through with peacekeeping forces and funding.\n\nDesignating Saudi Arabia a major non-NATO ally would formally acknowledge their standing as a strategic military partner with the US on the level of key allies like Israel, South Korea and Jordan.\n\n\"Major non-NATO status is a real feather in the cap of many nations ... in a sense it would essentially cement the US as the guarantor of Saudi security for forseeable future,\" said Nicholas Heras, a Middle East Security Fellow at the Center for a New American Security.\n\n\"It would put down on paper what has been the gentleman's agreement,\" he said, adding that it is a codified status.\n\nA tall task\n\nDespite indications that there could be room for the US and several Arab nations to negotiate some sort of an agreement related to Syria, the process of building an effective coalition of Arab nations committed to maintaining US strategic interests could be more difficult than it appears on paper.\n\n\"I don't know if the US should put full confidence in any regional partner when it comes to stabilizing Syria,\" Heras told CNN, adding that even the most capable Arab partners are also engaged in other conflicts that will likely continue to consume their attention.\n\nWhile Heras views Tuesday's comments from the Saudi foreign minister as a \"good start,\" the reality is that they have a difficult time defending their own southern border against the Houthis in Yemen, he said.\n\nThe conflict in Yemen also reveals many of the issues that arise when US-Arab partners are left to organize their own operations, he added, pointing out that the Saudis and Emirates have often clashed over differing strategic approaches.\n\nWhile offering major non-NATO status may help sweeten the deal for the Saudis, the US must also consider if it is willing to pay that big of a price for what is widely considered a risky investment.\n\n\"I think a genuine concern should be that some Arab allies would use operations in Syria as a pretext to engage in a larger proxy war against Iran and provide weapons to the rebels that might force our hands to become involved in the civil war in ways that are not in our best interest,\" said CNN military analyst John Kirby.\n\nThe UAE is also engaged in Yemen and, while they have demonstrated an ability to coordinate with various allies, they could be wary of contributing to a force in Syria at the same time.\n\nEgypt may have the manpower to serve as the backbone of a force in Syria but they lack the willpower to do so and have also had trouble dealing with several ongoing crises in their own backyard, according to Heras.\n\nThere is also the question of whether Arab nations would be up for the task from a military standpoint.\n\nDespite purchasing billions of dollars' worth of US defense equipment and weapons, most Arab military forces remain fundamentally limited in their capability. Many Arab nations lack a military capable of power projection or the ability to travel great distances, sustain themselves and sustain operations, Kirby said.\n\nAnd even the most advanced military forces in the region still rely on US for intelligence-gathering and targeting information from classified US satellites.\n\nAdditionally, these countries lack sophisticated special operations assets, enough refueling aircraft to sustain constant flight missions and the resources to establish security for bases inside Syria for multiple Arab nations.\n\n\"They would need -- and probably demand -- US logistical, ISR, and enabling support that, again, raises the stakes and costs of deeper American involvement in the civil war,\" Kirby said.","13":"(CNN) A Russian reporter known for his investigations into Russian mercenaries in Syria died after a fall from his apartment in the city of Yekaterinburg, raising fresh concern about threats to independent journalists.\n\nMaxim Borodin fell from his fifth-floor apartment and died Sunday, according to a statement released by his employer, Novy Den (New Day). Local police said they did not see any foul play, but his death prompted intense speculation among friends and colleagues.\n\nValery Gorelykh, spokesman for the Interior Ministry for the Sverdlovsk region, told CNN that Borodin's apartment was locked from the inside, a fact that he said indicated \"no one exited the apartment and most likely there were no strangers in there.\"\n\nRussia's Investigative Committee, the country's main investigative body, said there were no indications of a crime, and that multiple causes of death were being probed. Polina Rumyantseva, editor in chief of Novy Den, said that there was no reason to suspect suicide.\n\n\"We were able to visit the apartment of Maxim, together with the police and forensic experts on Friday, the intermediate conclusion is that Maxim fell out of the balcony of his apartment where he probably was smoking,\" she said. \"As Maxim had big plans for his personal life and career, there is nothing to support a verdict of suicide.\"\n\nRead More","14":"(CNN) The Syrians say some targeted sites didn't receive any damage.

The report itself also singled out Russia, emphasizing once again the disconnect between an administration willing to criticize Moscow and President Donald Trump's reluctance to do so. Acting Secretary of State John Sullivan said the governments of the four countries \"violate the human rights of those within their borders on a daily basis and are forces of instability as a result.\"\n\nHe added that \"States that restrict freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly; that allow and commit violence against members of religious, ethnic, and other minority groups; or that undermine the fundamental dignity of persons are morally reprehensible and undermine our interests.\"\n\nAllies such as Israel, along with others that have questionable track records, including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, were not singled out in the introduction.\n\nLike many administrations, the White House has stepped lightly when it comes to allies, but some aspects of the report -- particularly its decision not to refer to Palestinian territories as occupied and its care over alleged Saudi torture -- seem to mark striking concessions to them.\n\nCritics said the report is the latest indication that the Trump administration is putting human rights on the back burner.\n\n\"From the beginning, this administration has sent the message that the United States will no longer prioritize efforts to hold the global community to account for human rights,\" Joanne Lin, national director of advocacy and governmental relations at Amnesty International USA, said in a statement.\n\n\"Reports of the omission of key passages pertaining to sexual and reproductive rights, women's rights and the rights of marginalized populations, combined with the Administration's deference to known human rights violators like the governments of Saudi Arabia and Turkey, make us skeptical that these reports present a full picture of human rights around the world,\" Lin said.\n\nThose concerns surfaced last year, when then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson came under fire for breaking with tradition and declining to present the report in person when it was issued. More than once while he was in the job he expressed the view that human rights sometimes have to take a back seat to more pragmatic concerns.\n\nWhile it's too early to say what sort of emphasis Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo will place on human rights, he tipped his hat to the issue in his April 12 confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nHe told lawmakers that America's blessings come with a duty to lead. \"If we do not lead the calls for democracy, prosperity and human rights around the world, who will?\" Pompeo asked. \"No other nation is equipped with the same blend of power and principle.\"\n\nNotably, this year's report changes the way women's reproductive issues are addressed -- a move that has concerned some women's health and human rights advocates.\n\nBreaking with recent tradition, the document highlighted instances of coercive family planning, such as forced abortion, instead of referring to a broader range of reproductive rights including restrictions on access to abortion.\n\nAndrea Prasow, the deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement Friday that the report \"guts the analysis of sexual and reproductive rights, reflecting the Trump administration's hostility toward these issues.\"\n\n\"In doing so the administration is undermining a document that has long been relied upon by the Congress, foreign governments and activists alike to assess human rights conditions around the world,\" Prasow added. \"This is unfortunately only one facet of the administration's efforts to downplay human rights as an element of US foreign policy.\"\n\nLast year, the administration drew similar ire from advocacy groups over its decision to reinstate the so-called Mexico City policy barring nongovernmental organizations that advise women on abortion from receiving US funds.\n\nBut the State Department says it is simplifying the report -- which is congressionally mandated and intended to document the status of human rights and worker rights in nearly 200 countries and territories -- to return to its basic requirements under the law as it was applied prior to the Obama administration, and that it provides additional information on some abbreviated sections in hyperlink form.\n\n\"This year, we have sharpened the focus of the report to be more responsive to statutory reporting requirements, and more focused on government action or inaction with regard to the promotion and protection of human rights,\" Sullivan told reporters, speaking broadly about the document.\n\nThe report, available online and one of the government's most highly read publications, is broken down by region and country.\n\nThe Israel section was notable for a change in its categories. This year's report removed references to the West Bank and Gaza as \"occupied territories.\"\n\nWhereas last year the country section was titled \"Israel and the Occupied Territories,\" this year it is called \"Israel, Golan Heights, West Bank and Gaza.\" The report refers, at one point, to the \"Israeli-occupied Golan Heights,\" but the only place where it refers to Gaza or the West Bank as \"occupied\" is in a quote.\n\nHere are some highlights of the report.\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nSaudi Arabia's abuses included unlawful killings, execution without due process, torture, and arbitrary arrest and detention. Saudis lack basic freedoms, including freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, association, movement and religion, the report said.\n\nIn November, the Saudi government detained approximately 200 government officials, businesspeople and royal family members, ostensibly to investigate allegations of widespread corruption. The report offered odd, soft-pedaled language to describe allegations of torture, saying that, \"according to media reports, members of the security forces coerced with relative impunity at least some of the detainees to the point of requiring medical care.\"\n\nThe report noted that Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen resulted in civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure, and cited concerns by the United Nations and rights groups such as Amnesty International that Saudi strikes caused disproportionate collateral damage. Unusually, it paired that observation with a sentence noting that rebels in Yemen have fired missiles into Saudi territory.\n\nSyria\n\nThe Syria section of the report reads like a catalog of the absolute worst of human behavior.\n\nThe regime conducted extrajudicial executions and used rape -- including of children -- as a weapon of war. It committed massacres, starved its population, \"disappeared\" and tortured people by the thousands. Prisons are known for sexual violence, life-threatening conditions and the deliberate denial of medical care.\n\nSyria continued to use chemical weapons, including sarin and chlorine, against civilians, and to conduct widespread \"barrel bombing\" of civilians and residential areas. The government systematically attacked civilian infrastructure, including hospitals.\n\n\"Impunity was pervasive and deeply embedded in the security forces and elsewhere in the government,\" the report said.\n\nRussia\n\nBeyond the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its backing for Russian-led forces in Ukraine, where thousands of civilians have died, Russia was identified as a major violator of human rights within its own territory.\n\nThe most significant human rights issues included extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, life-threatening conditions in prisons, arbitrary arrest and detention, a lack of judicial independence and severe restrictions on freedom of expression and the media, to name a few.\n\nNew laws limit peaceful dissent and curtail the work of opposition politicians and civil society groups. There is \"widespread corruption at all levels and in all branches of government,\" the report said.\n\nThe government in Chechnya of Ramzan Kadyrov, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, committed abuses with impunity, including killings, torture, physical abuse and politically motivated abductions. \"Virtually none of these abuses was credibly investigated or prosecuted by either the federal government or local Chechen authorities,\" the report said.\n\nNorth Korea\n\nThe description of human rights abuses in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or North Korea, was a horrifying litany of extrajudicial killings; disappearances; arbitrary arrests and detentions; torture; and political prison camps in which conditions were often life-threatening and included forced and compulsory labor, as well as unfair trials and rigid controls over many aspects of citizen's lives.\n\nThe report also said there have been \"numerous reports\" that North Korea's government, which holds three American hostages, committed arbitrary and unlawful killings. Trump is set to meet North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, in the next few weeks.\n\nIran\n\nIran is a violator of rights at home and a driver of destabilization in Syria because of its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and for Hezbollah forces there and in Iraq, the report said.\n\nIran executes people without fair trials, tortures and arbitrarily detains people, invades their privacy, and restricts the press and all public expressions of dissent against the government.\n\n\"The government took few steps to investigate, prosecute, punish, or otherwise hold accountable officials who committed these abuses, many of which were perpetrated as a matter of government policy,\" the report said. \"Impunity remained pervasive throughout all levels of the government and security forces.\"\n\nMyanmar\n\nThe report calls out Myanmar's security forces and local militias for committing ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya minority population in 2017.\n\nThose groups, the report notes, \"reportedly committed widespread atrocities against Rohingya villagers, including extrajudicial killings, disappearances, rape, torture, arbitrary arrest, and burning of tens of thousands of homes and some religious structures and other buildings.\"\n\n\"We condemn the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya in Burma and the atrocities committed against them,\" Sullivan said in his remarks, referring to the country by its alternate name, \"and we are working with partners to address that crisis.\"\n\n\"Those responsible for the violations, abuses and attacks must be held accountable,\" he added.\n\nVenezuela\n\n\"Democratic governance and human rights deteriorated dramatically during the year as the result of a campaign of the Maduro administration to consolidate its power,\" the State Department said in its report, citing cases of excessive force used against protesters and widespread detentions.\n\n\"The most significant human rights issues included extrajudicial killings by security forces, including government sponsored 'colectivos'; torture by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; widespread arbitrary detentions; and political prisoners,\" the report states.\n\nThe Trump administration has frequently criticized President Nicolas Maduro's government, threatening further economic sanctions and a potential oil embargo if reforms aren't implemented.\n\nVenezuela is facing an economic crisis that has led hundreds of thousands to flee to neighboring countries.\n\nCuba\n\nWhile the US and Cuba restored diplomatic relations under the Obama administration, the two countries continue to find themselves at odds on a host of issues, including human rights and governance.\n\nThis year's human rights report calls out Cuba for issues including politically motivated detentions, torture and censorship.\n\nThe report, which covers developments in 2017, makes no mention of the recent political transition in Cuba.\n\nOn Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the US was \"disappointed that the Cuban government opted to silence independent voices and maintain its repressive monopoly on power, rather than allow its people a meaningful choice through free, fair and competitive elections.\"\n\nChina\n\nIn addition to singling out China as a force for instability in its preface, the report focuses on the country's police and judicial system, as well as \"significant restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, and movement.\"\n\nIn his remarks, Sullivan said, \"China continues to spread the worst features of its authoritarian system, including restrictions on activists, civil society, freedom of expression, and the use of arbitrary surveillance.\"\n\n\"We're particularly concerned about the efforts of Chinese authorities to eliminate the religious, linguistic and cultural identities of Uyghur Muslims and Tibetan Buddhists,\" he said, \"as well as restrictions on the worship of Christians.\"\n\nThe US and China have had an unsteady relationship in recent months, with Trump publicly praising Chinese President Xi Jinping, while blasting the country over its trade practices.\n\nTurkey\n\n\"In Turkey, the detention of tens of thousands of individuals including journalists and academics under an ongoing state of emergency has undermined the rule of law there,\" Sullivan said in his remarks, referring to a widespread crackdown initiated by the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan since a failed coup attempt in 2016.\n\nWhile the US and Turkey retain an important military alliance, their relations have become increasingly frayed as Erdogan has consolidated political power and aligned himself more closely with US foes like Russia and Iran.\n\nThe report notes that Turkey \"experienced significant political challenges during the year,\" but it criticizes widespread arrests, including those of two US mission employees.","16":"President Trump tweets \"Mission Accomplished\" after missile strikes in Syria, but what exactly that mission entails and whether the administration has a broader strategy in place remain unclear.\n\nSource: CNN","17":"Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

It said only seven missiles had reached two Syrian military airfields and that \"no serious damage to infrastructure was inflicted.\"\n\nRussian state news agency TASS reported that none of the missiles fired by the three Western nations struck areas near its naval and air bases in Syria.

In April 2017, the United States launched a military strike on a Syrian government airbase in response to a chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of civilians.\n\n\"Syria continues to engage in and provide a base for murderous actions, including those of Iran, that put its territory, its forces and its leadership at risk,\" the Israeli official said.\n\nThe strikes also sparked rallies against the military action.
