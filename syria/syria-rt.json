Four other members abstained, with Ethiopian representatives saying there\u2019s no point in voting for a resolution that would be vetoed anyway. The US, the UK and France \u2012 all permanent members with veto powers \u2012 voted against, killing the proposal. Apparently, when Macron spoke of unity at the UN, he meant unity behind the actions of London, Paris and Washington.\n\nWilly Wimmer, a former member of Germany\u2019s ruling CDU party, compared the behavior of the UK, the US and France to \u201cthe same attitude, which [was] used by Adolf Hitler in 1939 to enter into World War Two.\u201d\n\nCanadian PM Justin Trudeau and German Chancellor Angela Merkel quickly endorsed their allies\u2019 attempt to take the law into their own hands.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk likewise cheered on the intervention, saying the EU \u201cwill stand with our allies on the side of justice.\u201d\n\nNATO also endorsed the bombing in a statement on Saturday, declaring that the alliance \u201cconsiders any use of chemical weapons by state or non-state actors to be a threat to international peace and security.\u201d\n\nNATO Allies expressed full support for last night\u2019s actions in #Syria.

Rome would not allow the use of NATO bases on its soil for the airstrikes, but agreed to provide \u201clogistical support\u201d to the UK, the US and France.\n\n\u201cNow is not the time for escalation, it\u2019s time for diplomacy to give Syria democracy and pluralism after seven years of horrible conflict,\u201d the outgoing PM, Paolo Gentiloni, said.\n\nHowever, his potential replacement, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Northern League party, did not mince words when condemning the attack.\n\n\u201cWe are still looking for Saddam\u2019s 'chemical weapons,' we are still paying for the crazy war in Libya, and someone with a quick trigger finger is insisting on 'smart missiles,' only helping the nearly defeated Islamic terrorists. Total madness, stop it,\u201d he posted on Facebook.\n\nRead more\n\nThe head of Germany\u2019s Left Party (Die Linke), Sahra Wagenknecht, described the missile strike as \u201canother military violation of international law.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the illegal war against Yugoslavia in 1999, they [the US, the UK and France] want to have their own international structure,\u201d Wimmer, former vice-chair of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, told RT. \u201cThey are no longer interested in having an international organization which can work. And, therefore, they do their utmost to create their own world, where they can do what they want to do.\u201d\n\nMacron\u2019s decision to blindly follow the US was a \u201cbig mistake,\u201d Alain Corvez, a former adviser for the French ministries of defense and interior, told RT. \u201cAs a French patriot I am very disappointed with the loss of credibility that we had in the world.\u201d\n\nThe US, the UK and France set out to \u201cwreck international law without approval from UN and their own parliaments,\u201d Corvez said. They launched a \u201csmall strike without big consequences, because they understood that Russia would not let them crush Syria.\u201d\n\nConcern among neutrals\n\nSweden, which is a member of the EU but not of NATO, also called for the Syrian question to be resolved within the framework of the UN charter and international law, careful not to bring up the fact that both have been violated by the US, the UK and France.\n\nIt was pointless to discuss whether the US-UK-French strikes were legal, said Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstr\u00f6m. \u201cThey happened. Now we need to talk about what to do next.\u201d\n\nLatin American leaders also called for solutions within international law. Peru, which currently chairs the Security Council and is hosting the Summit of the Americas in Lima, called for moderation from all parties and backed a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d for Syria, according to its foreign ministry.\n\n\u201cIt's time to find permanent solutions based in the international law to a war that has been going for far too long and ended too many lives,\u201d Brazilian President Michel Temer told the leaders at the summit.\n\nPresident Mauricio Macri of Argentina also called for everyone to work \u201cin the framework of existing international commitments.\u201d\n\nThe bombing of Syria reminded Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic of the NATO attack on his own country in 1999.\n\n\u201cBeing on the side of power does not mean being on the side of morality and justice,\u201d Vucic said, emphasizing Serbia\u2019s current military neutrality.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?

And they\u2019re the only people who benefit from it.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: 'No release of chemicals is best proof there were none' \u2013 employee of bombed Syrian research site\n\nPatrick Henningsen, the executive editor of 21stCenturyWire.com, said that the missile salvo launched by the United States, France and Britain also served to drum up public support for the faltering Western governments back home. According to Henningsen, US President Donald Trump \u201clearned that you can get a bounce in the polls by taking some strong public military action, and certainly he did get that last year, he got that again this year.\u201d\n\nJust hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll, much higher than President Obama at same point. With all of the phony stories and Fake News, it\u2019s hard to believe! Thank you America, we are doing Great Things. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2018\n\nBogged down by the seemingly endless Russia collusion accusations, Trump was desperate for some positive news coverage, Henningsen argued. \u201cDonald Trump knows that if you declare war, you bomb a country, especially in the Middle East, that you will get the support of MSNBC, CNN, ABC, CBS \u2013all the mainstream media outlets will line up behind the president and call him \u2018presidential,\u2019\u201d Henningsen told RT. \u201cThese are the same people who have been attacking him over Russiagate over the last 18 months. That shows you how shallow the American media and political complex is.\u201d\n\nTrump may be particularly susceptible to negative media coverage \u2013 and desirous of a more cooperative, approving press \u2013 because the president \u201cprojects a sort of confidence, but I think he\u2019s tremendously insecure,\u201d Henningsen added.\n\nPutin: History pinned blame on US for \u2018bloody carnage\u2019 in Yugoslavia & Iraq, same will be with Syria\n\nThe strikes were carried out by a \u201crogue faction within the UN Security Council\u201d which has made a mockery of international law,\" Henningsen noted.\n\nOthers who spoke with RT about the strikes agreed, pointing out that transparency and the rule of law took a pounding from the missile attack.\n\nRead more\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May's decision to not seek parliamentary approval for the attack sets a dangerous precedent, Raddie told RT, adding that since the Thatcher years, Parliament has always been consulted before taking military action.\n\n\u201cAnd at least that means there is a debate, the evidence \u2013 if there is any \u2013 is publicized, and it\u2019s discussed in Parliament openly and transparently. None of that has happened,\u201d Raddie said. \u201cThe reason is because there is no evidence. Theresa May is now citing what she calls \u2018open sources.\u2019 We know who these open sources are \u2013 it\u2019s Bellingcat, it\u2019s the White Helmets, which is funded by the UK Foreign Office. So their own sources are themselves. So they couldn\u2019t actually take a vote and publish that evidence because it would have looked absolutely ridiculous.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was very revealing that the US and its allies chose to launch their missiles before the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) had a chance to conduct its on-the-ground fact-finding mission in eastern Ghouta.\n\nAndrej Hunko, a German MP from Die Linke, said that his left-leaning party condemned the strikes as a \u201cbreach of international law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no European decision to be involved [in the attack], and this weakens as well the European foreign policy,\u201d Hunko told RT.\n\nREAD MORE: Strike on Syria legitimate as 3 UNSC members acted - Macron\n\nHe noted that the majority of Germans \u201cdon\u2019t want to be involved\u201d in Syria, and called on Berlin to withdraw its forces from the country.\n\n\u201cThere should be a return to international law, to rule-based international dealings,\u201d Hunko said. \u201cWe are for strengthening international organizations, not putting them aside, like it was done [in this case].\u201d\n\nLike this story?
