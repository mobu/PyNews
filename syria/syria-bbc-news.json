But the US, UK and France - who support the opposition to Mr Assad - say they are confident that chlorine and possibly a nerve agent were used.\n\nDespite the uncertainty about what happened in Douma, a cluster of influential social media activists is certain that it knows what occurred on 7 April.\n\nThey've seized on a theory being floated by Russian officials and state-owned media outlets that the attacks were \"staged\" or were a \"false flag\" operation, carried out by jihadist groups or spies in order to put the blame on the Assad government and provide a justification for Western intervention.\n\nThe group includes activists and people who call themselves \"independent journalists\", and several have Twitter followings reaching into the tens or hundreds of thousands.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nThe activists call themselves \"anti-war\", but as they generally back the Syrian government's military operations against rebel forces seeking to overthrow Mr Assad and Russian air strikes carried out in support, it might be more accurate to describe them as \"anti-Western intervention\" or \"pro-Syrian government\".\n\nAccording to their narrative, international media organisations across the political spectrum, along with human rights organisations, are somehow covertly aligned with Western governments, Saudi Arabia, the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda and taking part in a secretive plot to take over Syria.\n\nImage copyright Twitter\/@VanessaBeeley\n\nThe network of activists includes people like Vanessa Beeley. She has more than 30,000 Twitter followers and writes for a news outlet that the website Media Bias\/Fact Check calls a \"conspiracy and conjecture site\" that has \"an extreme right bias\".\n\nIn response to a list of questions, she called BBC Trending's story a \"blatant attempt\" to \"silence independent journalism\" and repeated unsubstantiated claims about alleged chemical weapons attacks.\n\nImage copyright Twitter\/@VanessaBeeley\n\nInfluential accounts\n\nBeeley gives talks to fringe groups and makes appearances on media outlets including state-owned Russian channel RT.\n\nBut in the online conversation about Syria there are more influential activists, about whom much less is known.\n\nSarah Abdallah (@sahouraxo on Twitter) has more than 125,000 followers, among them more than 250 journalists from mainstream media outlets. Her follower count is comparable to BBC journalists who regularly report on Syria, such as BBC Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen (167,000) and BBC Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet (142,000).\n\nMore from Trending:\n\nIn addition to pictures of herself, Sarah Abdallah tweets constant pro-Russia and pro-Assad messages, with a dollop of retweeting mostly aimed at attacking Barack Obama, other US Democrats and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn her Twitter profile she describes herself as an \"Independent Lebanese geopolitical commentator\" but she has almost no online presence or published stories or writing away from social media platforms. A personal blog linked to by her account has no posts.\n\nHer tweets have been quoted by mainstream news outlets, but a Google News search indicates that she has not written any articles in either English or Arabic.\n\nShe refused to comment several times when approached by BBC Trending and did not respond to specific requests to comment on this story in particular.\n\nImage copyright Twitter\/@sahouraxo Image caption In several pictures posted by Sarah Abdallah, items in the background - such as the house in this picture - are common to North America, rather than Lebanon\n\nWhite Helmets\n\nThe Sarah Abdallah account is, according to a recent study by the online research firm Graphika, one of the most influential social media accounts in the online conversation about Syria, and specifically in pushing misinformation about a 2017 chemical weapons attack and the Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are widely known as the \"White Helmets\".\n\nThe White Helmets operate in rebel-held areas. They have been one of the sources that Western media outlets, including the BBC, have quoted about alleged chemical attacks in Syria. With regard to the incident in Douma, the BBC has not been able independently to verify the group's reports.\n\nGraphika chief executive John Kelly says his company's analysis showed distinct patterns emerging.\n\n\"When you're looking at these disinformation campaigns, a lot of the same characters show up for every party,\" he told BBC Trending.\n\nGraphika was commissioned to prepare a report on online chatter by The Syria Campaign, a UK-based advocacy group organisation which campaigns for a democratic future for Syria and supports the White Helmets. The White Helmets have been the subject of two Oscar-nominated documentary films and have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nGraphika found 20 million messages about the White Helmets, split between tweets in support and in opposition. Among the opponents, Kelly says, Sarah Abdallah was \"by far the most influential\", followed by Vanessa Beeley.\n\nThe firm found that Sarah Abdallah's account was primarily followed by a number of different interest clusters: supporters of pro-Palestinian causes, Russians and Russian allies, white nationalists and those from the extremist alt-right, conservative American Trump supporters, far-right groups in Europe and conspiracy theorists.\n\nThese groups were instrumental in making the hashtag #SyriaHoax trend after the chemical weapons attack in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017.\n\nThat hashtag, pushed by Sarah Abdallah and influential American conservative activists, became a worldwide trend on Twitter. Many of those tweeting it claimed that the chemical weapons attack was faked or a hoax.\n\nImage copyright Twitter\/@sahouraxo\n\nBeeley said the 2017 attack had \"been debunked by a number of highly respected analysts and experts.\" She alleged that evidence \"points to the White Helmets as a propaganda construct\" and asked, via email: \"Why has the BBC never carried out an investigation into the White Helmets?\"\n\nExperts from a joint UN-OPCW mission said in October 2017 that they were confident a Syrian Air Force jet dropped munitions containing sarin on Khan Sheikhoun, dismissing statements from Russia that the jet had fired conventional munitions at a rebel chemical weapons depot.\n\nDrowned out\n\nThe difficulty in reporting on the ground in Syria has opened up an information vacuum which has been partially filled by highly partisan sources, according to Scott Lucas, a professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham and editor of news and analysis site EA Worldview,\n\n\"None of it is journalism; none of it is really based on solid independent reporting,\" Lucas says.\n\n\"It is absolutely right to question all narratives, including official narratives of what is happening,\" he says. \"The key is that you don't actually start with a narrative, you start with the facts and you establish what may not be true and what may even be disinformation.\n\n\"The danger we face is, unreliable information is now being taken up by more established - and what we would think of as - more reliable outlets,\" he says.\n\nSyria 'chemical attack': What we know\n\nAnd although the activists' follower accounts continue to grow, there is one indication that their influence online might be on the decline compared with last year.\n\nIn the hours after the alleged attack in Douma, \"Syria\" was a top trending term on Twitter, but the messages by pro-Assad activists were drowned out by reports from a range of news outlets.\n\nThe hashtag #SyriaHoax was used around 17,000 times in a week (compared to more than 280,000 times in April 2017), and mostly failed to make Twitter's lists of top trends.\n\nDo you have a story for us?

The Charter allows states to use force in self-defence and, arguably, for the protection of populations threatened by extermination at the hands of their own government. The use of force for broader purposes of maintaining international security is also possible. However, such action is subject to the requirement of a mandate from the UN Security Council.\n\nThis arrangement tries to balance the need of states to preserve their security in the face of an actual or imminent attack through self-defence when strictly necessary with the need to ensure that force cannot be used as a routine tool of international politics. Hence, international law since 1945 precludes military strikes in retaliation - to teach other states a lesson, as it were - or by way of reprisal. Reprisals are acts that are in principle unlawful, but they can be excused because they aim to force a state back into compliance with its international obligations.\n\nHence, in 1981 Israel was condemned by the UN Security Council when it attacked the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq. Israel had argued that it might contribute to the production of weapons of mass destruction in the future. A US attack against an alleged chemical weapons facility in Sudan in 1998 in response to US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania was also criticised.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption \"Righteous power\" in the words of President Trump - to deter \"the production, spread and use of chemical weapons\"\n\nIn this instance, the three states mounting the air strikes have taken it upon themselves to force Syria into compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Syria joined the Convention in 2013 as part of the diplomatic settlement that followed the failure of the UK, and the US, to go through with threatened air attacks after gruesome chemical attacks in Eastern Ghouta. The Convention prohibits the production, possession and use of chemical weapons. No fewer than 192 states have signed.\n\nSyria was also subjected to additional duties contained in mandatory Security Council resolution 2118, reinforcing these obligations and providing for the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile. In an impressive example of international co-operation, also involving Russia, this was largely achieved a year later, by September 2014.\n\nRussian veto\n\nHowever, since then, there have been some 40 recorded instances of alleged chemical weapons use in Syria. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has the ability to dispatch fact-finding missions to determine whether such weapons have actually been used.\n\nA special joint mechanism was set up by the OPCW and the Security Council with a mandate to assign responsibility for such uses. However, after the mechanism pointed the finger at the Assad government last year, Russia vetoed its renewal.\n\nAn attempt to establish a new mechanism empowered to determine responsibility for the latest use of chemical weapons in Douma failed this week, again due to a Russian veto in the Security Council. Russia's own proposed investigatory mechanism, which was opposed by the Western states and others, would have lacked that power.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Supporters of President Assad were defiant after the air strikes\n\nThe three states intervening in Syria now argue that there was no prospect of obtaining a mandate from the Council to confront chemical weapons use by Syria. In striking Syria, they claim to have fulfilled an international public order function of defending the credibility of the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons in general terms, and enforcing Syria's obligations in particular.\n\nThis argument is somewhat reminiscent of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, supposedly to enforce Baghdad's disarmament obligations imposed by the Security Council in the absence of clear Security Council authorisation. Moreover, in April of last year, President Trump launched 59 cruise missiles against the Syrian air-base at Shayrat. It was claimed that the installation had been involved in a chemical attack in the town of Khan Sheikhun, again to restrain further chemical weapons use.\n\nThe blockage in the Security Council on Syria opens up some space for this kind of argument. The Chemical Weapons Convention provides for referral of grave instances such as the Douma attack to the Security Council for enforcement action. But the Council could not even agree on a mechanism to establish responsibility, not to speak of more decisive action to repress future uses of such weapons.\n\nThe claim of the three states involved to act instead of the Council, as the world's enforcement agent of a highly important international rule, is of course being resisted by some. Russia has already asserted that the attacks flagrantly violate the prohibition of the use of force. The UN secretary general has also emphasised the need to respect the primacy of the Security Council.\n\nHumanitarian suffering\n\nThe arrogation of the functions of the Council by a group of states claiming to act in the common interest therefore reflects the reality of the present, little Cold War between Russia and the West. The breakdown of the consensus that facilitates the operation of collective security necessarily results in unilateral acts and, in consequence, further division.\n\nIn addition to the general interest in maintaining the obligation to refrain from chemical weapons use, Mrs May also referred to the protection of civilians from further chemical attacks to alleviate further humanitarian suffering. This, in fact, is a stronger and more persuasive legal argument in favour of the strikes.\n\nIn fact, the formal legal argument put forward by the UK government sometime after the prime minister addressed the nation does not rely on the claim to enforce the terms of the chemical weapons convention or of resolution 2118.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Theresa May made the humanitarian argument\n\nIn 2013, when the use of force was expected after the Ghouta attack, the UK already expressly invoked the doctrine of humanitarian intervention. A good argument has been made that states can act in cases of overwhelming humanitarian necessity that cannot be addressed by any other means to protect populations in danger of imminent destruction.\n\nThe doctrine of forcible humanitarian action gained credence throughout the 1990s when it was applied to rescue the Kurds of northern Iraq and the Marsh Arabs in the south of Iraq from destruction by Saddam Hussein. It was later employed unopposed in cases including Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\nHowever, international division about its application emerged in the wake of the operation on behalf of the Kosovo Albanians of 1999.\n\nSince then, the UN has embraced the concept that international action can be taken to rescue a population under immediate threat. However, the doctrine of responsibility to protect (R2P) was narrowed down to cover operations mandated by the Security Council. Still, a number of states claim a right to act when the Council cannot.\n\nInnocent civilians at risk of destruction should not pay the price for a political blockage at UN headquarters in New York. Others, including Russia and China, oppose humanitarian intervention.\n\nThe application of this doctrine is not restricted to uses of chemical weapons against civilian populations. However, given the uncontrollable and indiscriminate effect of chemical weapons, their use against civilians offers perhaps the clearest trigger for the application of this doctrine.\n\nIn this instance, the UK points to the history of repeated uses of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, adding that it is \"highly likely\" that further such attacks would follow. Given the failure of previous attempts to rein in this practice, and the present blockage in the Security Council, it is argued that no means other than the use of force were available to secure the humanitarian objective of the operation.\n\nMoreover, it is asserted the force used was strictly limited and specifically targeted at objects connected with the objective of degrading the capacity to launch future chemical attacks and deterring such attacks in the future. These arguments conform to the legal requirements for humanitarian intervention.\n\nIt could also be argued that the attacks aim to preserve the national security of the states involved in the attacks, by way of an extensive right to self-defence. Diluting the protection stemming from the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons in recent practice posed a threat to all states.\n\nOf course, every state may defend itself, under some circumstances even before an armed attack aimed at it has landed on its territory. But the attack must be imminent, leaving no choice of means and the response must be proportionate to the attack.\n\nIn the run-up to the Iraq war of 2003, there was the famous 45-minute claim concerning Iraq's supposed weapons of mass destruction. Laying the ground for an argument of anticipatory self-defence against a strike that might come in the future, the UK argued that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction might reach UK military bases in Cyprus with minimum warning.\n\nBut there was no evidence that Baghdad was contemplating such an attack and the argument was abandoned. Similarly, there is no suggestion in this instance that Syria was preparing to launch an attack against the US, UK or France.\n\nMarc Weller is Professor of International Law in the University of Cambridge and the editor of the Oxford University Press Handbook on the Use of Force in International Law.","2":"'At least in heaven there's food'\n\nThis is the cost of five days of relentless air strikes for children in Eastern Ghouta, Syria.","3":"Image copyright PA\n\nThis was a heavier strike than a year ago - three targets rather than one.\n\nThen, the US acted alone; this time it was joined by its French and British allies.\n\nMore than double the number of weapons were fired against Syrian targets than last year - a little more than 120 in all.\n\nBut the fundamental question remains the same.\n\nWas this enough to achieve what the Americans say was their goal - to deter President Bashar al-Assad from using chemical weapons again?\n\nAssad's effective victory\n\nSince April a year ago Syria's torment has not ended. But two fundamental things have changed.\n\nFirstly, the Assad regime has effectively won its war and terrorising civilians has played a key part in its strategy.\n\nPresident Assad may not control all of Syrian territory. But backed by Russia and Iran, there is nobody that can really stand against him. It is shortages of manpower, equipment and capacity that prevent him re-establishing wider control.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Syrians wave Iranian, Russian and Syrian flags after the western strikes\n\nSecondly, relations between Washington and Moscow - and between Russia and the West more generally - have deteriorated significantly, to the extent that senior international officials are now talking of a new Cold War.\n\nThis was the context in which President Trump determined to send his punitive message to the Assad regime. And this is the context in which they will have received it.\n\nWill they be cowed or defiant? Will public bluster conceal a more fundamental re-think on the part of Mr Assad? Might Russia, whatever its spokesmen say, have a stern word with the Syrian leader? And if they did, would it have any effect?\n\nTrump's distraction\n\nWatching this crisis unfold from the United States, I found it both perplexing and in many ways worrying.\n\nThere seemed to be a lack of focus and clarity on the part of the Trump administration. Hardly surprising, perhaps, when the president himself was increasingly bogged down in his own domestic difficulties as allegations and recriminations about alleged past affairs and misbehaviour returned to haunt him.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption President Trump is dealing with multiple domestic issues\n\nAt times he seemed more likely to strike out at the US justice system than at President Assad. Indeed over the past week, while much of the rest of the world worried about what Mr Trump might do about Syria, the media here has been dominated, absorbed and fascinated, in equal measure, by Mr Trump's difficulties almost to the exclusion of all else.\n\nPresident Trump's rhetoric suggested a major military strike against the Assad regime. In the event what has taken place falls far short of that. So what conclusion might Moscow and Damascus draw?\n\nSoft targets\n\nThe Pentagon seems to have gone out of its way to avoid both civilian and \"foreign\" casualties - for that read \"Russians\".\n\nThe three targets hit were chosen both for their central role in the chemical weapons programme but also because the risk of collateral damage was smallest.\n\nThe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff noted at a subsequent briefing that the US had a list of other targets which it did not choose to strike this time. The clear message is that if the Assad regime resorts to chemical weapons again then more strikes will follow.\n\nBut again, since last April there have been a number of other alleged chemical weapons attacks, generally using chlorine gas. But until now the US did not strike again. So what message did this send?\n\nImage copyright AFP \/ Syrian governement Image caption An explosion seen in the night sky over Damascus\n\nNow the hope is that Mr Assad will change his behaviour. But what about the wider Syrian conflict? This brutal war shows no sign of ending. Many have pointed out that it is barrel bombs, artillery and bullets that are responsible for the overwhelming bulk of the deaths and mutilations in Syria, not chemical weapons, and yet it is these that prompt Western action.\n\nThere is a good measure of truth in this sentiment, though for historical and cultural reasons chemical weapons have a particular horror in the West in the wake of their use in World War One. The treaty banning them is an important disarmament agreement and its weakening threatens to unwind years of progress.\n\nBut the wider question is to what extent these latest strikes change the picture in Syria? Do they bring the conflict any closer to an end? Sadly the answer is almost certainly no.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis briefed the media after the strikes took place\n\nOnly a short while ago - much to his generals' horror - Mr Trump spoke about pulling all US troops out of Syria. Only days later he seemed to be threatening a major military intervention. There has been no consistency in the Trump administration's position.\n\nThere is simply no clear strategy to help bring the war to an end. Indeed one of the arguments for keeping US troops in Syria to bolster their local allies like the Kurds, was in fact to keep the Assad regime and its Iranian backers off-balance.\n\nConstraining Iran is about the only unifying theme in the Trump administration's approach, but even this has not been raised to the level of a coherent strategy. In his statement after the strikes the President again asserted that the US was not seeking an indefinite presence in Syria.\n\nHis hope was clearly that as others shouldered the burden (who?) the US might walk away. But this was followed by a catch-all statement about the intractability of the region and its problems, which hardly suggests a desire for a long-term engagement.\n\nIf these are the signals coming from Washington, then why should Russia worry?\n\nRussia's rise\n\nIt has, through its military, and political support for the Assad regime, re-established itself as a significant diplomatic actor in the region. Russia, of course warned the US and its allies not to strike Syria. So in the wake of this attack what might Russia do?\n\nIn Syria itself, it might seek to further undermine Washington's already weak position but it is not going to war with the Americans - such fears, barring some extraordinary disaster, were always, probably, far-fetched.\n\nUS Defence Secretary James Mattis has already hinted at Russia's likely response noting that \"we fully expect a significant disinformation campaign over the coming days by those who have aligned themselves with the Assad regime\".\n\nIndeed this campaign has in many ways already begun, with the Russians - who now have forces in the area where the recent chemical attack is alleged to have occurred - insisting first that there was no sign of a chemical attack and then, more recently, that the whole thing was staged by foreign agents to discredit Mr Assad and Moscow.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Russia's President Putin was recently returned in a presidential election\n\nThis is the same Russia that is accepted by most Western governments to have been behind the attempted assassination of a former Russian intelligence officer and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury, using a nerve agent. It is the same Russia that has tried to influence the US and other recent elections. It is President Putin's Russia that has seized part of Ukraine. One could go on. The misinformation battle has already been joined.\n\nThe new Cold War\n\nThere is indeed a new sort of Cold War developing. It may not risk nuclear annihilation, but because of that it is in many ways more direct and unpredictable, with Moscow taking much greater risks than it might have done in the past.\n\nRussia is not a global superpower like the Soviet Union. It no longer has an ideology that gathers support from liberation movements around the world. It is fundamentally a middle-ranking regional power with a significant nuclear arsenal and a relatively weak economy. But it knows how to wield influence and how to conduct information warfare. And Mr Putin is determined to defend Russia's interests - as he sees them - wherever he is able.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption A missile destined for Syria is launched from a French vessel in the Mediterranean\n\nMostly this means in Russia's near-abroad, that is countries close to its borders that have been traditional Russian spheres of interest - such as Georgia or Ukraine. Syria is almost an honorary member of the near-abroad, affording Russia an entry point to regain its influence in a region that still matters. Russia's star is rising and Washington's influence is in many ways on the wane.\n\nAnd this matters. For instability in the region is growing. The ripples from a previous US administration's decision to remove Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq are still spreading. Iran was the principal benefactor of that decision. It has become a formidable regional player.\n\nIts growing influence in Syria risks a major conflict with Israel. Recently, Israel is believed to have struck at a Syrian base which was home to an Iranian facility.\n\nTensions are rising. The region's many fault-lines risk merging.\n\nAnd the US, British and French attacks over-night have inevitably thrown another pebble into the pool.","4":"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Seth Doane from CBS News visits the scene of the 'chemical attack' in Douma\n\nEfforts by international experts to examine the scene of a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria have been delayed again after a UN risk assessment team came under fire.\n\nShots were fired when a security team visited Douma on Tuesday to prepare for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inspectors' visit.\n\nNobody was injured and the team returned to the capital, Damascus.\n\nWestern states have accused the Syrian government of a chemical attack.\n\nThe US, UK and France bombed several Syrian government sites on Saturday in retaliation as the government and its main ally Russia denied chemical weapons had been used.\n\nWestern powers have suggested the government and Russia, which nominally control Douma after rebel forces withdrew, may be delaying the OPCW visit to tamper with evidence.\n\nLocal medical organisations and rescue workers say more than 40 people died when two devices were dropped on Douma, while it was still under rebel control.\n\nWhat happened on Tuesday?\n\nThe UN security detail set out to perform reconnaissance in Douma ahead of the arrival of the actual inspectors, who were scheduled to go in on Wednesday.\n\nAs OPCW chief Ahmet Uzumcu explained in a statement, the two suspected attack sites are under the control of the Russian military police as part of an agreement with the rebels to keep out the Syrian military.\n\nWhen the security team arrived at the first site, a large crowd gathered and the UN decided to withdraw.\n\nAt the second site, \"the team came under small arms fire and an explosive was detonated,\" said Mr Uzumcu.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The OPCW inspectors are staying at the Four Seasons Hotel in Damascus\n\nAt that point the UN team decided to return to Damascus.\n\nMr Uzumcu said he did not currently know when the OPCW inspectors could deploy to Douma.\n\n\"This incident again highlights the highly volatile environment in which the FFM [fact-finding mission] is having to work and the security risks our staff are facing,\" he said.\n\nThe nine-strong FFM team has been waiting in Damascus since Saturday.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Unverified video shows children being treated after alleged gas attack\n\nUS state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert warned on Tuesday that the delays in getting the OPCW experts into Douma to gather soil samples and other information would \"further degrade\" any evidence on the ground.\n\nFrance's foreign ministry said it was \"very likely that proof and essential elements\" were \"disappearing from this site\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has told BBC News the allegations of chemical weapons use were \"based on media reports and social media\" and that the incident was \"staged\".\n\nWhat do we know of the 7 April incident?\n\nOn the day of the suspected chemical attack, Douma was still under rebel control, the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus after a bloody government offensive.\n\nThousands of people were sheltering in basements from the government's bombardment, when two bombs filled with chemicals were allegedly dropped several hours apart on two separate locations.\n\nThe US, UK and France say that, based on open-source information and their own intelligence, they are confident chlorine and possibly a nerve agent were used.\n\nThe government denies using chemical weapons and says the attack was fabricated.\n\nA correspondent for US network CBS who gained access to the alleged attack site in Douma on Monday was told by one resident: \"All of a sudden some gas spread around us.

But Sweden - so often the place that countries have looked to follow on social policy - has not been so successful at integrating migrants over the past 20 years.\n\nA short drive from the centre of Stockholm, the suburb of Rinkeby is an island of breeze-block flats and estates that even the snow struggles to beautify.\n\nA riot last year gave the impression of a Swedish dystopia in this neighbourhood made up mainly of immigrants and their children.\n\nBut some people here are angry at the way their neighbourhoods have been stigmatised, particularly by the country's right wing, and say they seem to be drifting away from mainstream Sweden.\n\nImage caption Hashim and Amin helped set up an anti-violence group in Rinkeby\n\nHashim and Amin, both of Somali origin, helped set up a local anti-violence group. They accept that some types of violent crime are increasing but accuse the government of failing to invest in these areas.\n\n\"Instead of finding a solution for the complex problems you call them a 'no-go zone'. It's just labelling it, making it easy for police to decide for people, instead of including people in the decisions,\" said Amin.\n\nHashim added: \"I don't think Swedish society is very open for immigrants, there's a lot of xenophobia.\"\n\nSweden's government denies it is immigrants who are causing the rise in crime.\n\n\"The people who are causing problems for us today, the vast majority of them are born in Sweden, and that's not a notion of migration. That's an issue of integration and an issue of social inclusion,\" said Justice Minister Morgan Johansson, a centre-left Social Democrat.\n\n\"One per cent of the population in our Swedish prisons are Syrians. One percent are from Afghanistan.\"\n\nImage caption The justice minister denies that the rise in crime is linked to immigration\n\nThe government insists it is tough on crime and tackling its causes.\n\nBut as many people in Sweden become increasingly concerned about violence, it may be harder to convince them that accepting large numbers of migrants will not lead to further social problems down the line.\n\nThe justice minister accepts that violent crime will be an issue in September's election but would rather voters focus on Sweden's strong economic growth.\n\nAnd the far right here are looking to emulate the successes of other anti-immigration parties elsewhere in Europe.","8":"Image caption Students show posters of detained colleagues\n\n\"It was 04:00 when the police came beating at my door.

The spat became public on Tuesday, when Mr Kudlow sought to clarify the administration's position on the sanctions.\n\nHe said Ms Haley was \"doing a great job\", adding: \"There might have been some momentary confusion about that. I think the issue here is we have a set of sanctions and additional sanctions are under consideration but have not been determined.\"\n\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter\n\nNikki Haley has been one of the few top members of the Trump team who has carved out space apart from the president's dominating influence. She's been a forceful foreign policy voice in an administration that has undercut, and churned through, other members of the presidential national security and international affairs team.\n\nBeing situated in New York and not Washington has probably helped - but her good fortune may be ending. First, the president reportedly blocked one of her senior aides, who was anti-Trump in 2016, from becoming Vice President Mike Pence's national security adviser. Then came the stern White House rebuke after her announcement on Sunday of forthcoming sanctions on Russia.\n\nIt's the sort of public dressing down that has led some to suggest she resign in protest. A New York Times article hints that there may be a longer game here, however - a budding alliance between Ms Haley and Mr Pence that could lay the groundwork for a Republican future after Mr Trump.\n\nIf that includes even the hint of contingency plans for 2020, when Mr Trump says he will run for re-election, the newly tense relations between the president and Ms Haley could quickly reach a breaking point.\n\nAfter Ms Haley denied being \"confused\", in an interview hours later, Mr Kudlow called her to apologise, the New York Times reported.\n\n\"I was wrong to say that,\" he told the newspaper. \"She was basically following what she thought was policy. The policy was changed and she wasn't told about it, so she was in a box.\"\n\nHowever observers say the exchange has highlighted rifts within the Trump team.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded\n\nMs Haley is regarded as a major foreign policy figure in the administration, especially since the dismissal of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last month.\n\nTensions between Russia and Western countries have risen since the US, the UK and France carried out strikes in Syria last week in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack.\n\nRussia and Syria, its ally, insist that no chemical attack took place in the rebel-held town of Douma on 7 April.","14":"Image copyright AFP Image caption Andrew Brunson has been detained since October 2016\n\nAn American pastor on trial in Turkey has denied charges of aiding a terrorist organisation, in a case that has frayed Turkey-US relations.\n\nAndrew Brunson is accused of helping a group led by Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Muslim preacher who Turkish authorities allege was behind a failed 2016 coup.\n\nMr Brunson, who ran a Protestant church in the Turkish city of Izmir, was arrested in October 2016.\n\nIf convicted, he faces up to 35 years behind bars.\n\nMr Brunson, 50, an evangelical pastor originally from North Carolina, appeared in court on Monday in the town of Aliaga for the first day of his trial. Also in court were Sam Brownback, the US ambassador at large for religious freedoms, and US Senator Thom Tillis.\n\nMr Brunson's lawyer, Cem Halavurt has called the charges \"totally unfounded\", saying they are based on testimony from secret informants. He told the AFP news agency ahead of the hearing that his client was \"both nervous, but also excited because it is the first time he will appear before a judge. He has expectations and a hope\".\n\nProsecutors say Mr Brunson worked with a group led by Mr Gulen, who is living in exile in Pennsylvania in the US, as well as with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).\n\nTurkey has designated both Mr Gulen's network and the PKK as terror groups, and accused My Gulen of fomenting an attempted military coup in the country in 2016, in which at least 250 people died.\n\nMr Gulen has denied any involvement in the attempted coup, and the European Union has said it does not share Turkey's view that his network is a terror organisation.\n\nMr Brunson, who has lived in Turkey for 23 years, serving as pastor of the Izmir Resurrection Church, was among those swept up in a massive crackdown by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, following the failed coup. More than 50,000 people were arrested in the crackdown, as well as 100,000 state employees fired and newspapers and TV stations shuttered.\n\nTurkey initially accused the pastor of being a member of both Mr Gulen's network and the PKK, but apparently adjusted the charges before the trial, accusing him of working on the groups' behalf.\n\nTense relations\n\nRelations between Turkey and the US were already strained over American support for Kurdish militias in Syria, which have been targeted by Turkish forces. Turkey has formally sought the extradition of Mr Gulen, but the US says it has not been given sufficient evidence to back up the request.\n\nIn September, Mr Erdogan raised the prospect of a swap, exchanging Mr Brunson for Mr Gulen, but the idea was dismissed by the US authorities, who have pressed Turkey to release the pastor.\n\nAccording to CeCe Heil, executive senior counsel at US Christian group the American Center for Law and Justice, Mr Brunson has lost 50lb (23kg) during his detention and been denied private meetings with his lawyer.\n\nMr Brunson's daughter, Jacqueline Furnari, told a US commission investigating the crackdown in Turkey that she had postponed her wedding in her father's absence.\n\n\"I'm still waiting for my dad to walk me down the aisle, and I'm still waiting for that father-daughter dance,\" she said.\n\nThe trial continues.","15":"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded\n\nPresident Donald Trump has warned Syria's government the US is \"locked and loaded\" to strike again if it carries out chemical attacks.\n\nThe warning came after the US, UK and France struck three Syrian sites in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack in the town of Douma a week ago.\n\nSyria denies any chemical use and says that attack was fabricated by rebels.\n\nA UN Security Council vote brought by Syria's ally, Russia, to condemn the US-led strikes was rejected.\n\nThe wave of strikes represents the most significant attack against President Bashar al-Assad's government by Western powers in seven years of Syria's civil war.\n\nWhile Western powers have supported rebels from early on in the war, they have not intervened directly against Syrian government forces.\n\nCatch up on the strikes:\n\nAfter the failure of the Russian motion, the US, UK and France circulated a new draft resolution to UN Security Council members, calling for an independent investigation into Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons, AFP news agency reported.\n\nSimilar previous plans have been vetoed by Russia.\n\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May has blamed Russian obstruction for the need to launch military strikes, saying they left \"no practicable alternative\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Syria air strikes: Do they work?\n\nIsn't an investigation already under way?\n\nInspectors from the independent Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) had already been dispatched to Damascus and they are expected to visit Douma this weekend.\n\nBut the OPCW will not seek to establish - and publicly announce - who was responsible for the attack, which is what the UK, US and France want to see.\n\nThe new, Western-drafted resolution calls for the OPCW to release their report within 30 days.\n\nSyria's Assistant Foreign Minister Ayman Sousan told the BBC his government welcomed the OPCW delegation.\n\n\"The work of the mission is in the interest of the Syrian state as it will uncover the lies, hypocrisy and the misinformation of the sides which had promoted the alleged use of chemical weapons,\" he said.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told the BBC the strikes in Syria were meant to signal that \"enough is enough\" and their \"primary purpose is to say no to the use of barbaric chemical weapons\".\n\nRussia has said it believes the attack in Douma was staged.\n\nWhat happened at the UN?\n\nAn emergency meeting was held by the UN Security Council on Saturday, leading to some bitter exchanges.\n\nRussia sought to secure a collective condemnation of the early morning air strikes.\n\nHowever, out of the 15-member council, only China and Bolivia voted in favour of the Russian resolution.\n\nRussia's UN envoy, Vasily Nebenzia, read out a quote from President Vladimir Putin accusing the US, UK and France of \"cynical disdain\" in acting without waiting for the OPCW's findings.\n\nUS envoy Nikki Haley said she had spoken to President Trump: \"And he said: 'If the Syrian regime uses this poisonous gas again, the United States is locked and loaded.'\"\n\nShe added: \"We cannot stand by and let Russia trash every international norm and allow use of chemical weapons to go unanswered.\"\n\nSyrian envoy Bashar Jaafari called the US, UK and France \"liars, spoilers and hypocrites\" who exploited the UN \"to pursue...

Under the Dublin rule, people typically have to seek asylum in the first EU state they reach.\n\nIn 2015, at the height of Europe's migrant crisis, over 90,000 people applied for asylum in Austria, more than 1% of the country's population.\n\nInitially the refugees were welcomed, but the mood in the country quickly changed.\n\nSupport for the far-right, anti-immigrant Freedom Party - then in opposition - grew, and Austria's centre-right conservative People's Party, led by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz also campaigned strongly against migration.\n\nThese days, since measures were introduced to try to close off the Balkan route, the number of migrants reaching Austria has dropped significantly.\n\nIn the first three months of this year, 3,992 people claimed asylum in Austria, compared with 14,400 in the same period in 2016.\n\nBut the government is continuing with its hard line.\n\nIt wants to end what Interior Minister Herbert Kickl, of the Freedom Party, calls \"abuse\" of the asylum system.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Sebastian Kurz, from the centre-right conservative People's Party, campaigned against migration\n\nThe bill does not just target mobile phones. It will also allow the authorities to seize up to \u20ac840 ($1,037; \u00a3730) in cash. The money will be used to pay for the upkeep of migrants as they wait for their asylum claims to be processed.\n\nAustria is not alone. Denmark, Germany and Switzerland have also permitted the confiscation of valuables belonging to refugees to pay for their stay. In Denmark, some reports suggest the authorities have not received large amounts of money from the policy.\n\n\"We have very deliberately set ourselves the goal of fighting against illegal migration but also against the misuse of asylum,\" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said at a news conference after the weekly cabinet meeting.\n\n'Disproportionate interference'\n\nThe bill, which must now be passed by parliament, would also force hospitals to tell the government when asylum seekers will be discharged, to ensure effective deportations.\n\nAnd the measures mean that refugees will only be able to apply for Austrian citizenship after 10 years, as opposed to six years which is currently the case.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Human rights groups have criticised the Austrian government's plans (file photo)\n\nDeportations of asylum applicants convicted of crimes will also be speeded up.\n\nOpposition parties and human rights groups have condemned the plans.\n\nAmnesty International said the plans to seize phones was \"a completely disproportionate interference in people's private affairs\", and that displaced people were being lumped together as cheats or a security risk.\n\nIt said the only thing the bill achieved was to create more \"uncertainty and mistrust among the population\".\n\nA note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants."},"URL":{"0":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/blogs-trending-43745629","1":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-43766556","2":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/av\/world-middle-east-43769842\/syria-air-strikes-12-hours-in-two-minutes","3":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-43764344","4":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-43792120","5":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-43852220","6":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/in-pictures-43724085","7":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-43667367","8":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-43731563","9":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-43767156","10":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-43850979","11":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-43769282","12":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-43770102","13":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-us-canada-43806960","14":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-43781891","15":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-43771840","16":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-43781351","17":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-43849270","18":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/av\/world-us-canada-43763406\/trump-syria-strikes-to-deter-chemical-weapons-use","19":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-europe-43823166"}}
