The data came from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database.\n\nThe researchers computed the average annual death rate among the men according to race, intent (such as homicide or suicide) and firearm involvement. They also calculated any inequalities in those age-adjusted rates between the two groups. In total, their analysis included 84,113 homicides and 251,772 suicides.\n\nCompared with white men, the researchers found that black men experienced 27 more firearm homicides per 100,000 people annually nationwide (29.12 for black men vs. 2.1 for white men). The states with the highest rates of firearm homicide among black men in the data -- namely Missouri, Michigan, Illinois and Indiana -- also had the largest disparities between blacks and whites, the researchers found.\n\nSuicide rates were found to be higher among white men than black men. Compared with black men, the researchers found that white men had nine more firearm suicides per 100,000 people annually nationwide (5.41 for black men vs. 14.34 for white men).\n\nSix of the 10 states with the largest disparities in firearm suicide rates were in the southern part of the country: Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Texas, South Carolina and Louisiana, the researchers found. The other four were in the West: Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado.\n\n\"The most surprising thing to me when I was conducting the analysis was how different the rates were across states,\" Riddell said.\n\n\"We knew going into it that whites would have a higher rate of suicide and that black men would have a higher rate of homicide, but to see that level of variation in the rates across states was surprising,\" she said. \"Any time I see variations so large like that, that can't be due to chance. I want to know why the differences exist.\"\n\nThe researchers also examined the relationships between gun ownership and these homicide and suicide rates by race and state. They used 2004 data, the most recent available, on household firearm ownership in the US from the CDC's national Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\n\nThey found that rates of gun ownership in a state were positively associated with both homicide and suicide rates among white men but only modestly associated with homicide and suicide rates among black men.\n\nJUST WATCHED People impacted by gun violence share stories Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH People impacted by gun violence share stories 13:14\n\nSome studies have found that black and white Americans hold opposing attitudes about gun ownership and knowing someone who has been harmed by guns.\n\nAccording to that report, 57% of black adults said they knew someone who has been shot , compared with 43% of whites and 42% of Hispanics. Also, the report found that 32% of blacks said they or someone in their family had been threatened or intimated by someone with a gun, compared with 20% of whites and 24% of Hispanics.\n\nMore research is needed to answer 'why'\n\nThough the new study adds to the growing conversation about guns in the United States, it also had some limitations.\n\n\"The biggest limitation is that in our study, we only looked at fatalities, but non-fatal gun injuries make up a large proportion of the total burden of gun-related injury,\" Riddell said.\n\n\"When we're talking about firearm suicide attempts, they're about 80% to 90% fatal,\" she said. But for firearm attempted homicides, \"they're closer to being 20% fatal. So in our study, we're missing most of the burden of firearm injuries associated with attempted homicide.\"\n\nOther limitations include that the study focused on death certificates, which sometimes can be misclassified; only data on non-Hispanic black and white men were analyzed, which means more research is needed to determine whether similar findings would emerge among other groups; and the data on gun ownership were outdated, as they came from 2004, years before the other data in the study.\n\n\"The study uses national vital statistics, data from death certificates, to compare rates of firearm-related homicide and suicide deaths between black and white men by state. The strengths and limits of this investigation reflect the inherent strengths and limits of death certificates for this type of work,\" said Dr. James Buehler, clinical professor of health management and policy at Drexel University Dornsife School of Public Health in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the study but has researched health disparities in America.\n\n\"The limits of death certificates are that they do not provide much contextual information about the circumstances of people's lives in general or the circumstances surrounding their deaths in particular,\" Buehler said.\n\n\"This study, like any study that depends on death certificate data, paints a broad picture. It lets you see large patterns and make general inferences when the findings are triangulated with what is known from other research, and it lets you frame questions for further investigations,\" he said. \"But this type of study generally cannot answer questions that begin with the word 'why.' \"\n\nEven though the study couldn't explain why there were these differences in gun deaths by race and states, the researchers offered some ideas.\n\nThe firearm suicides appeared to occur at the highest rates in rural settings while the homicides occurred at the highest rates in urban settings, the researchers noted.\n\nThis urban-rural divide could suggest that social and geographic isolation, having access to lethal mechanisms and stresses related to agricultural work play a role in high suicide rates among white men in rural areas. Higher levels of income inequality and crowding, among other factors, in metropolitan areas could play a role in high homicide rates among black men in urban areas, the researchers wrote in the study.\n\nHow to reduce disparities\n\nThough not noted in the study, other factors known to cause health disparities between groups include social determinants , or the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, according to the CDC. Such determinants include sociological life differences, socioeconomic status, and access to and utilization of adequate health care.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"The large difference in homicide and suicide rates across states suggest that rates of homicide and suicide can be reduced by focusing on states with very high rates and learning from the states with the lowest rates. So there's more work to be done,\" Riddell said.\n\n\"To reduce disparities, it's important to know what types of deaths are reduced by a particular policy. For example, policies that focus on background checks for mental health or on safe storage of firearms may be effective at reducing firearm suicide more than firearm homicide,\" she added. \"Reducing these suicides is a worthy pursuit, but it is also important to implement changes that are linked to reductions in firearm homicide in order to reduce racial inequalities and gun deaths overall.\"","3":"(CNN) They presented as the ultimate Oregon hippie moms. But peel back the homeschooling, organic food and music festivals, and Jennifer and Sarah Hart appeared to embrace a twisted philosophy on child rearing, according to two tipsters' accounts to authorities in 2013.\n\nThat philosophy was on display a year after the women wed when in 2010 -- in what seems straight out of the cult classic, \"Mommie Dearest\" -- the Harts declined to foster a friend's teenage daughter because she \"used wire hangers against the Harts' wishes,\" according to a Minnesota Child Welfare report cited in the Oregon report.\n\nBefore a legally intoxicated Jennifer Hart drove her wife and at least four of their six adopted children off a cliff in Mendocino County, California, last month, the family had drawn the attention of child welfare authorities in both states after multiple reports that the kids were neglected and malnourished.\n\nIn the Oregon report, which was released this week to Oregon and Washington media outlets that filed records requests with the Oregon Department of Human Services, two women reported the children were denied food and subjected to harsh punishments, such as being forced to lie on the floor for hours, one tipster claimed. Sometimes, punishment was meted out for behavior common to being a child, such as laughing at the dinner table.\n\nJUST WATCHED Family's car plunges off cliff in California Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Family's car plunges off cliff in California 01:13\n\nOne tipster called anonymously, while the other, who claimed to be a former friend of the Harts, asked that her identity not be revealed.\n\nBecause the anonymous tipster mentioned that the cars outside the Harts' West Linn, Oregon, home had Minnesota plates, Oregon officials called Minnesota and received a report stating Jennifer Hart had viciously spanked 9-year-old Abigail and Sarah had taken the rap for it.\n\nYoung Abigail's transgression, according to the Minnesota report? She told her parents that she had found a penny, but her mothers didn't believe her. Jennifer Hart spanked the girl, leaving bruises all over her lower torso, the girl told authorities, adding that Jennifer Hart had also put her hands on her neck and stuck her head under cold water. Sarah Hart copped to the beating and was convicted on two charges.\n\nEleven days earlier, Abigail alleged, Jennifer had banged her head against the wall after school officials reported Abigail had been digging through the garbage and taking other children's food.\n\nOregon authorities were thus aware of the family's history in Minnesota when investigating the tipsters' allegations in 2013. The state Department of Human Services investigators found there were \"some indications of child abuse or neglect,\" but they were \"unable to determine\" whether the accusations were legitimate, despite picking up on disturbing, if not prosecutable, signs, the report said.\n\nThe department said in a Monday statement it was releasing the records because it was \"in the best interest of helping inform measures to be taken to prevent a similar incident from happening again in Oregon or any other state.\" It also outlined several changes to its model for investigating cases like this one.\n\nThe Hart children smiled for photos, but away from the camera, they appeared \"lifeless,\" a tipster said.\n\nToday, Abigail and three of her siblings are dead, along with their mothers. Two children remain missing, though authorities suspect the pair were in the doomed SUV and were washed away by the surf.\n\nHere is what we know about each child, and the findings of Minnesota and Oregon authorities, as laid out in the Oregon report:\n\nHannah, the hungry\n\nThe 16-year-old is one of two children who remain missing after the crash.\n\nSeemingly the most outspoken of the youngsters when it came to reporting alleged abuse, Hannah had been telling adults about her mothers' behavior since at least 2010.\n\nIn December of that year, a Minnesota social worker noticed a dime-sized bruise on her hand, which Hannah said was the result of Jennifer Hart striking her for lying. She further claimed her \"mom, Jen, hits her all the time,\" but authorities were unable to validate the claims.\n\nIn January 2011, Minnesota Child Welfare reported her classmates had been giving her food, and when she told a school nurse she had not eaten one day, Jennifer Hart grew angry and called her disrespectful.\n\n\"Hannah said Jen shoved a banana in her mouth as well as some nuts,\" the Minnesota report said. When Sarah Hart was asked about concerns with Hannah's diet, she replied, \"She's playing the food card; just give her water.\"\n\nThe Minnesota social worker said that \"after a while, the school stopped calling the parents about the child(ren) taking food because they didn't want the children being disciplined or punished,\" the report said.\n\nWhen she was interviewed in Oregon in 2013, Hannah, then 11, was missing her front teeth, and her mothers said she'd knocked them out running on hardwood floors the previous year. The women said a dentist had told them Hannah would have to wait until she was at least 17 \"for a retainer with teeth.\"\n\nThe anonymous tipster said Hannah and her biological brother, Markis, bore the brunt of Jennifer Hart's discipline, but the girl made no mention of previous abuse to the Oregon social worker.\n\nAbigail, the tiny\n\nIn the 2010 penny incident outlined in the Minnesota report, Jennifer and Sarah Hart had discovered a penny in Abigail's pocket. When they asked the girl about the penny, she said she'd found it and got a spanking because her mothers thought she'd stolen it.\n\nDespite Abigail blaming Jennifer, Sarah Hart claimed responsibility for the bruising from Abigail's sternum to her waist, and from her mid-back to upper buttocks, saying \"it just got out of control,\" according to the report. In 2011, Sarah Hart was convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence assault in the fourth-degree, and she pleaded guilty to attempt to inflict bodily harm.\n\nThree years later, like Hannah, Abigail made no mention of the abuse when the Oregon social worker asked about discipline in the home.\n\nThe girl was 6 at the time, but the Minnesota social worker remarked that she looked more like a 2-year-old. When pressed about her size, the Hart women uttered a familiar refrain: Their adopted children were \"high risk\" and had \"food issues.\" A doctor told social workers \"she is just small,\" the report said.\n\n\"The Minnesota Child Welfare worker said the problem is, 'these women (Jen and Sarah Hart) look normal' and they give professionals the information about all the children being adopted because they are high needs, and have mental health issues related to food, then people tend to assign the problems to the children,\" the report said.\n\nAfter the Oregon interview, during which Abigail was 9, the social worker remarked she was \"very reserved, showing little emotion or animation.\"\n\nWhen she was adopted at age 2, Abigail had been \"labeled borderline mentally retarded,\" but her mothers said they felt the diagnosis was inaccurate and she'd improved academically. The mothers often disagreed with their children's previous diagnoses, according to the Oregon report.\n\nAbigail also suffered from asthma, allergies and visions problems, the Oregon report said.\n\nThe 14-year-old was one of the three children found dead at the accident scene last month.\n\nDevonte, the extrovert\n\nDevonte, 15, remains missing after the crash. Both tipsters said he was \"the favored child.\"\n\nHe was the most outgoing of the kids and gained brief fame after giving a Portland, Oregon, police officer a hug during a demonstration decrying the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nThen-12, Devonte Hart and Sgt. Bret Barnum share a hug at a rally in Portland.\n\nHis hugs were a hit at music festivals, Jennifer told the social worker. While Sarah Hart worked, Jennifer Hart was often on the road taking the children to festivals.\n\nAccording to the unidentified former friend, \"Jen does this thing for her Facebook page, where the kids pose and are made to look like one big happy family, but after the photo event, they go back to looking lifeless.\"\n\nDevonte, who was 10 at the time of his Oregon interview, was social, clean and well-dressed. He wore a fedora, the report said.\n\nWhen he was adopted at age 6, the Hart mothers said, the only words he knew were curse words. He suffered abuse by his biological parents and was exposed to violence and drugs, and once had a gun put to his head, according to the report.\n\n\"At that time, the couple report he did not even know where his fingers and toes were. Additionally, he was reported to be very violent and would kick and bite,\" the report said.\n\nHe was diagnosed with mood disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and prescribed psychotropic medications, assessments with which his mothers did not agree. They had taken him off the meds, they said.\n\n\"He is reported by his parents to be thriving in home school and very interested in social justice\/issues and love. He is reported and observed to be very affectionate,\" the report stated.\n\nMarkis, the targeted\n\nThe biological brother to Abigail and Hannah, Markis, 19, was found dead at the crash scene.\n\nThe oldest of the six children, the \"somewhat soft-spoken and reserved\" Markis was 15 and in ninth grade when the Oregon social worker dropped by. He seemed thin, though a doctor said there was nothing abnormal in his physical exam.\n\nMarkis said that he'd been abused in foster care and \"reported being grateful to Ms. J. Hart and Ms. S. Hart for changing his life,\" according to the report. He said the family attended music festivals for fun and indicated he was happy to be in Oregon where there was more opportunity and the family was \"contributing to the world.\"\n\nThe former friend, who alleged that Jennifer Hart coached her kid on how to act and what to say, said Markis received more discipline than the other children. Jennifer Hart had told the woman that Markis once tried to kill her, but Devonte had saved her.\n\n\"She indicated that on another occasion, while the family was visiting in her home, Ms. J. Hart alleged Markis tried to punch her and drug him in the home. Despite Ms. J. Hart's report, Ms. (name redacted) does not believe this and reported she also did not hear Markis yelling as reported by Ms. J. Hart.\"\n\nOn another occasion, the ex-friend said that Markis had gotten into trouble on his birthday, and as punishment, the mothers forbade anyone from wishing him, \"Happy birthday.\"\n\nMarkis had been on psychotropic medication when he was adopted, but he had since been taken off the regimen and his mothers reported no behavioral or mental issues, according to the report.\n\nJeremiah, the fittest\n\nHe had turned 14 about a month before he died. He was 9 when interviewed, and the Oregon report says he is the only one of the children who was the correct size and height for his age.\n\nHe was \"very reserved\" during his interview and, according to his mothers, needed eyeglasses.\n\nBefore adoption, Jeremiah had been diagnosed as autistic and the Hart women claimed he was \"globally delayed\" -- like their other children -- when they gained custody of him.\n\n\"The couple said Jeremiah could not even use a fork when he came to them, but was functioning normally now,\" the report said.\n\nHe was also taking prescribed medications \"for a variety of issues\" when they adopted him, but no longer needed those, his adopted parents said.\n\nCiera, the youngest\n\nShe would've celebrated her 13th birthday last week. The biological sister of Jeremiah and Devonte, Ciera was found almost two weeks after the accident, and police later identified her as one of the six Hart children.\n\nCiera was 8 when the Oregon social worker interviewed her.\n\n\"Like her siblings, she appeared small for her age and was noted to be very reserved when interviewed,\" the report said, adding that a doctor had detected nothing abnormal despite her weight and stature.\n\nShe told the social worker she was in second grade and enjoyed being home-schooled. No behavioral or mental issues were reported.\n\n'These children risk falling through the cracks'\n\nIn another incident, the former friend said she had invited Jennifer Hart and the children over to her home and they ordered pizza. Jennifer Hart would allow the kids only one small piece, and when everyone woke up in the morning, the remaining pizza was gone.\n\n\"Ms. J. Hart became angry and said she knew who ate it. Ms. J. Hart then took her children to the bathroom and after coming out, told she and her husband none of her children would be eating breakfast as no one fessed up to eating the pizza,\" the tipster said.\n\nJennifer Hart then forced all six kids to lie on an air mattress \"with sleeping masks on their face and their arms by their side for five hours,\" she said.\n\nThe Oregon social worker worried that because the children were home schooled, they did not have \"regular contact with any mandatory reporters.\" Perhaps that was by design, as Minnesota Child Welfare said the family pulled their kids out of school and later vanished following that department's investigation.\n\nJUST WATCHED Questions surround family killed off cliff Replay More Videos ...

Days before they died, a neighbor contacted authorities to say the women had been mistreating their children and withholding meals. Devonte had been coming by as often as three times a day, asking for food, neighbor Bruce Dekalb said\n\nHe called Child Protective Services on March 23, and officials arrived just after Jennifer Hart came home from work, but she didn't answer the door. The next morning, the family was gone. Child Protective Services tried to visit again March 26 and 27, but didn't make contact, the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services said.\n\nOne line in the Oregon report warns that something bad might befall the children, given their lack of contact with the outside world.\n\n\"Without any regular or consistent academic or medical oversight, and unknown child welfare reviews through State of Texas for either foster\/adopt subsidies, these children risk falling through the cracks,\" it said."},"URL":{"0":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/23\/politics\/ohio-john-kasich-gun-control\/index.html","1":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/25\/politics\/beau-biden-gun-violence-protection-act-delaware\/index.html","2":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/23\/health\/gun-deaths-in-men-by-state-study\/index.html","3":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/25\/us\/hart-family-crash-oregon-report\/index.html"}}
