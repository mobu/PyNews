Because I drank and smoked while I was pregnant with him.\"","1":"Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThe spouse of one US president and the mother of a second, Barbara Bush was never content to accept a passive role as political wife.\n\nA long-time campaigner for social justice, she spoke out against racial segregation and threw her weight behind the drive to eradicate illiteracy in America.\n\nAt times she had to tone down her more liberal views to avoid clashes with her husband's party.\n\nThis included her natural instinct to take a more pro-choice side in the abortion debate.\n\nShe was born Barbara Pierce in New York City on 8 June 1925, the daughter of a magazine publisher.\n\nIt was while she was still at school - at just 16 - that she met fellow student George Herbert Walker Bush and the couple became engaged in 1943.\n\nShortly afterwards, her fianc\u00e9 went off to serve in the US Navy as a pilot.\n\nImage copyright George Bush Presidential library Image caption Barbara married George HW Bush while still a teenager. 'I married the first man I ever kissed,' she would joke. 'When I tell this to my kids they just about throw up.'\n\nThey married in 1945 and the new Mrs Bush spent 18 months as a navy wife before her husband was discharged.\n\nLater, she would quip that 'I married the first man I ever kissed. When I tell this to my children they just about throw up.'\n\nThey moved to Connecticut when George was accepted at Yale and it was there that her first son, George Walker Bush, was born in July 1946.\n\nThe family then moved to Texas where her husband got a job with an oil company run by a friend of his father. He eventually founded his own oil development company in 1950.\n\nFor the next nine years Barbara Bush fulfilled the role of wife and mother, while her husband built up his business.\n\nThe death of their three-year-old daughter Robin from leukaemia in 1953 inspired Mrs Bush to campaign on behalf of cancer charities. An interest in improving literacy was sparked when her son Neil was diagnosed as dyslexic.\n\nConflict\n\nShe also became aware of segregation in the South after driving across America with two African-American women in order to reach a holiday home in Maine.\n\nShe discovered, to her horror, that her two companions were not allowed to sleep or eat in the same hotels and restaurants as white people.\n\nFor the rest of her life she spoke out against racial bigotry, often finding herself in conflict with right wingers in the Republican Party.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption In the first years of her marriage she devoted herself to her family. She and George would have 6 children together.\n\nShe became a political wife in 1964 when George campaigned, unsuccessfully, to become a Republican Senator for Texas.\n\nBut, two years later, he entered Congress and his wife launched herself into political life, working for various Republican women's organisations.\n\nIn 1970, after George Bush failed for a second time to reach the Senate, President Richard Nixon appointed him US ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nBarbara Bush relished the opportunity to make new contacts among the international community and was able to widen that circle when her husband was posted to Beijing by President Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford.\n\nIn the mid 1970s, George was appointed as Director of the CIA. It was a difficult period in Barbara's life during which she suffered from a deep depression.\n\nIn her autobiography, she recalled how she would have to stop her car on the side of a highway for fear she would deliberately crash into a tree or an on-coming vehicle.\n\n'Night after night, George held me weeping in his arms while I tried to explain my feelings,' she wrote. 'I almost wonder why he didn't leave me. I knew it was wrong, but couldn't seem to pull out of it.'\n\nShe never sought medical help for her feelings, which she put down to a combination of the menopause and the stress of her husband's job. The despair vanished after about six months.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption She relished the role of political campaigner although her views on issues like abortion were more liberal than her husband's.\n\nWhen George entered the primaries for the Republican presidential nomination, Barbara campaigned enthusiastically for him.\n\nThe couple's relatively liberal views on abortion and equal rights were at odds with the growing influence of the conservative wing of the Republican Party under Ronald Reagan.\n\nWitty speaker\n\nThe former California governor's decision to invite George Bush to be his vice presidential running mate meant Barbara had to publicly toe the party line on these issues.\n\nAs the wife of the vice president, Barbara Bush stepped up her campaign to improve adult and child literacy, putting her weight behind organisations working in the field.\n\nShe also emerged as an entertaining and witty public speaker, and her experience of two vice presidential campaigns stood her in good stead when her husband ran for the White House in 1988.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption She campaigned to eradicate illiteracy in the US\n\nWhen she appeared at the Republican convention that nominated him, she became the first wife of a candidate to speak in support of their husband.\n\nOnce in the White House she founded the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, designed to raise money for literacy programmes.\n\nShe also made regular radio appearances on a programme called Mrs Bush's Story Time, which championed the benefits of parents reading aloud to their children.\n\nShe continued her drive to improve civil rights in America and was reputed to have been influential in the appointment of the first African-American to her husband's cabinet.\n\nAvoiding clashes\n\nNot all her beliefs were shared by her husband. Her support for gun control elicited strong reaction from his supporters in the powerful National Rifle Association.\n\nAnd she toned down her relatively pro-choice views on abortion to avoid clashes with powerful groups within the party which might have threatened the stability of her husband's presidency.\n\nHowever, she returned to the subject of abortion during the 1992 campaign, stating her belief that it was a private matter and something on which the Republican Party should not take a position.\n\nHer husband failed to gain a second term in the White House, losing to Bill Clinton, and Barbara found more time to spend on her campaigns.\n\nLife outside the White House came as something of a shock to the former First Lady. She realised she hadn't cooked for 12 years and her driving had become appalling. Her husband warned anyone to get out of the way if they saw her car approaching.\n\nImage copyright CHRIS WILKINS Image caption With her son at the Republican national convention in 1992. George W Bush would become Governor of Texas two years later. Barbara was far from sure he would win.\n\nShe also had a new candidate to support - her son, George W Bush, was elected to the White House in 2000 and again in 2004.\n\nBarbara appeared on public platforms with him, notably in front of pensioner audiences, to promote his reforms of social security. Throughout the campaign she harboured grave doubts that he would win.\n\nAt George W Bush's inauguration, she became the first woman in US history to have witnessed both her husband and son sworn in as President of the United States.\n\nAbigail Adams was married to the second US president, John Adams, and was the mother of the sixth, John Quincy Adams, but she did not live to see their son elected.\n\nBack on the campaign trail\n\nShe was unswervingly loyal to her family but did not automatically extend that support to every member of the Republican Party.\n\nAsked in 2010 about former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Mrs Bush was damning.\n\n\"I sat next to her once, thought she was beautiful,\" she told an interviewer before adding \"I think she's very happy in Alaska, and I hope she'll stay there.\"\n\nIn 2013, she joked on NBC that the country had probably \"had enough Bushes\" but soon had to swallow her words when another son, Jeb Bush, announced he too would run for the Presidency.\n\nAt the age of 90, she found herself back on the campaign trail in Jeb's support - although he would ultimately be unsuccessful in his attempt to secure the Republican nomination.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption She joined her son Jeb in 2016 as he campaigned to become the Republican presidential candidate\n\nIn 2017, Barbara and her husband were given standing ovations at the 2017 Super Bowl. She also actively campaigned on behalf of the victims of hurricane Katrina.\n\nRecently, suffering from heart and respiratory disease, she decided to decline any further medical treatment and return to the family home in Houston.\n\nDuring long career in public life, Barbara Bush remained a witty and independent-minded bastion of support to her husband and son in the course of their presidencies.\n\nAs first lady, she steered a middle course between the public deference of Nancy Reagan and the more high profile role of Hillary Clinton.\n\nAnd like many of her predecessors, such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Helen Taft, she found this gave her room to champion her own causes behind the scenes.","2":"Image copyright Getty Images\n\n\"I still refuse to go to a festival that is owned by someone who is anti-LGBT and pro-gun\".\n\nThose were the words from Cara Delevingne as she explained her decision to boycott Coachella to her 41m fans on Instagram on Sunday.\n\nDespite being left \"speechless\" and in tears by what she called Beyonce's \"iconic\" headline performance, the 25-year-old continues to protest against the alleged values of its billionaire owner Philip Anschutz - who has been linked with far-right Christian evangelical groups.\n\nDelevingne, a supporter of gay rights and herself sexually fluid, added that she should be \"allowed to shame that man and the festival and still show my appreciation of an artist at the same time\".\n\nIn response to the model's remarks, Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) released a statement saying it \"wholeheartedly\" supports the LGBT community.\n\nThe statement said: \"Our recent support of the Elton John AIDS Foundation and its vital work speaks to our organization's true values.\"\n\nAnschutz went on to express \"regret\" if any money given to charities \"may have worked against these values\".\n\n\"That was not my intention, it does not reflect my beliefs, and I am committed to making sure it does not happen again\".\n\n'Fake news'\n\nAnschutz, 78, made his initial fortune through the oil, road and telecom industries before forming AEG in 1999.\n\nImage copyright Getty\/AFP Image caption Delevingne came under criticism for her remarks after posting about Beyonce's Coachella performance\n\nIts live music arm, AEG Live, bought Goldenvoice in 2001 which operates Coachella, as well as a host of venues worldwide - including the London O2.\n\nBut the accusations - which Anschutz denies - relate to payments made to hard-line conservative religious and political groups across the US, through his charitable foundation.\n\nThese include allegedly supporting:\n\nAnti-gay laws - According to US campaign group Freedom For All Americans, Anschutz allegedly gave \u00a335,000 to the National Christian Foundation (NCF) between 2011 - 2013.
