{"Content":{"0":"The National Rifle Association\u2019s political wing saw its biggest fundraising month in 15 years this March, as the national debate around gun control rages on.\n\nRead more\n\nAccording to Federal Election Commission filings, the NRA\u2019s Political Victory Fund raised $2.4 million in March, the largest haul for the gun-rights group since June 2003. Many of the donations were under $250, and came from retirees.\n\nBefore March\u2019s record haul, donations to the NRA had tripled in February, in the aftermath of the Parkland high-school shooting. The NRA received almost $800,000 in donations in February, compared to almost $250,000 in January.\n\nThe Parkland shooting prompted survivors to organize the \u2018March for Our Lives\u2019 movement, which saw 500,000 protesters descend on Washington DC calling for stricter gun-control laws.\n\nThe movement was joined by several prominent businesses and financial institutions. Bank of America announced this month that it would stop lending to companies that manufacture \u2018assault-style\u2019 weapons. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Walmart \u2013 two of the nation\u2019s leading gun sellers \u2013 said they would raise the minimum age of purchase to 21 and stop selling \u2018assault-style\u2019 weapons.\n\nThe pushback against the Second Amendment has not been welcomed by all. Membership in gun-rights groups also spiked after the Parkland tragedy, and two weeks ago the NRA announced that it aims to sign up 100,000 new members in the next three months.","1":"Parents of two children killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre are suing Infowars frontman Alex Jones for defamation. Jones has consistently claimed the shooting was a hoax and the parents of the victims are actors.\n\nThe 2012 shooting, perpetrated by 20-year-old Adam Lanza, resulted in the deaths of 20 elementary school children and six adults. Despite this, noted right-wing conspiracy theorist Jones continues to insist it was a \u201cgiant hoax\u201d and those behind it are advocates for gun control.\n\nThe first of two lawsuits, filed in Austin, Texas, where Jones resides and from where he broadcasts his Infowars show, was filed by Leonard Pozner and his ex-wife, Veronique De La Rosa, whose son Noah Pozner was killed.\n\nThe second was filed by Neil Heslin whose son Jesse was murdered, both boys were six years old. The parents are seeking $1 million in damages from Jones and his company Infowars and Free Speech Systems LLC.\n\nRead more\n\nBoth suits relate to comments made last year by Jones. The first of which occurs during an Infowars segment, aired last April, entitled \u2018Sandy Hook Vampires Exposed.\u2019 In the show Jones references an interview given by De La Rosa, after the murders, with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper.\n\nDuring the piece Cooper's nose seems to disappear leading Jones to claim that they are both actors and his nose \u201cdisappears repeatedly because the green screen isn\u2019t set right.\u201d In June, during a profile of Jones, NBC\u2019s Megyn Kelly interviews Heslin, who tells her that: \u201cI lost my son. I buried my son. I held my son with a bullet hole through his head.\u201d\n\nJones later took umbrage with this statement claiming that: \u201cQuite frankly, the father (Heslin) needs to clarify, NBC needs to clarify, because the coroner said none of the parents were allowed to touch the kids or see the kids and maybe meaning at the school. I\u2019m sure later maybe the parents saw their children.\u201d\n\nDespite the lawsuits, conspiracy-laden articles and videos relating to Sandy Hook continue to appear on the Infowars site and YouTube channel. One claims that the FBI says that no one was killed in the massacre and another claims that Sandy Hook officials are \u201crunning scared\u201d having been \u201ccaught\u201d in a \u201ccover-up.\u201d\n\nLike this story?

Organizers say at least 2,600 walkouts are planned, with at least one in every state.\n\n#NOW: Students from Niskayuna High School walked out and made their way to the town hall next door for a rally.

Hogg livestreamed the walkout at Stoneman Douglas High School, garnering over 200 thousand views.\n\nRemember after you guys walk out, volunteer! Spend the rest of your day working in your community. This is also a day of service in remembrance of the Columbine Victims. #NationalSchoolWalkout \u2014 David Hogg (@davidhogg111) April 20, 2018\n\nHogg, who appears to be aware of the wishes of Columbine High School, encouraged students to take part in voluntary service in their communities after the walkout.\n\nStudents in Washington DC took their walkout to the White House where they took part in nineteen minutes of silence to commemorate the anniversary.\n\n#NationalSchoolWalkout: At the White House.

Columbine High School students, however, are not taking part in the walkout and are instead marking the day by working on community service projects.\n\n\u201cWe know another walkout has been planned by various groups, however, in Jeffco the month of April has long been a time to respectfully remember our loss, and also support efforts to make our communities a better place.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease consider planning service projects an activity that will somehow build up your school, or perhaps pre-Day Without Hate event on April 20 as opposed to a walkout,\u201d the school said in a statement signed by the current principal Scott Christy and the principal at the time of the massacre, Frank DeAngelis.\n\nThe letter was issued to other high schools in the suburban Denver district earlier last week, according to KMGH-TV. Junior at the high school Kaylee Tyner told the news outlet that the anniversary was about remembering the victims and their families. \u201cEvery other day can be a day to push for change,\" she said.\n\nThirteen people - twelve students and one teacher - were killed when two high school students opened fire at Columbine High School in Colorado on April 20, 1999. The two perpetrators also died in the attack.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?

However, its title \u2018Never Again\u2019 has angered Holocaust survivors and their relatives.\n\nHogg\u2019s book charts the rapid growth of the movement, including the \u201cMarch for Our LIves\u201d rally that saw a reported 500,000 anti-second amendment protesters descend on Washington, DC. The book\u2019s title borrows a phrase traditionally used in remembrance of the Holocaust.\n\nHogg and his sister Lauren announced the book\u2019s launch in a pair of tweets on Wednesday. The announcement comes just two days before the planned nationwide school walkout protest \u2013on April 20\u2013 in support of tougher gun control measures.\n\nToday @lauren_hoggs and I are announcing our book #NeverAgain that tells the story of the foundation of this movement for those we lost.

Don't tell me you did Nazi this one coming. https:\/\/t.co\/DenMJJskWI \u2014 Mike S. Adams (@MikeSAdams) April 19, 2018\n\nI have soooooo many problems with politicizing the phrase #NeverAgain. It\u2019s a term used to memorialize the Holocaust (and, to a lesser extent, to memorialize the victims of the September 11th attacks). It is deeply gross to use that phrase to push for a divisive political agenda. https:\/\/t.co\/vr2utXER8h \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) April 18, 2018\n\nHogg has been relentless in calling for strict gun control since the Parkland tragedy in February. In addition to helping organize the \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d protest, he has publicly called for boycotts against Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham and against banks that lend to weapons manufacturers and retailers.\n\nThe book describes itself as \u201ca manifesto for the movement begun that day, one that has already changed America\u2013with voices of a new generation that are speaking truth to power, and are determined to succeed where their elders have failed.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hogg, the proceeds of the book will be used to \u201chelp heal the community.\u201d The publisher will make a donation to Everytown for Gun Safety, an anti-gun action fund set up by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nAn earlier attempt at promoting gun-control armbands using the hashtag #NeverAgain backfired on the Hoggs, after actor James Woods blasted it on social media as tone-deaf.

As it turns out, Russia\u2019s president isn\u2019t even on their radar any more.\n\nSure, the DNC might be suing Russia, Trump and WikiLeaks, and NPR might be trying to intimidate progressive activists by claiming that appearing on \u201cRussia-backed media\u201d will \u201ccomplicate\u201d their lives, but none of that really matters, you see.

One notable inclusion, in the Pioneers category, was former President Barack Obama\u2019s praise in the TIME magazine issue of five student activists from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Kyle Kashuv, one of the MSD students who disagrees with the quintet\u2019s gun-control agenda, challenged Obama\u2019s puff piece for ignoring the real influencers, the parents of two students slain in the February 14 mass shooting.\n\nIt's an absolute shame that @BarackObama gives no credit to @rpetty and @AndrewPollackFL who actually got the legislation passed.\n\n\n\n\"Already, they\u2019ve [the Parkland students] had some success persuading statehouses and some of the biggest gun retailers to change.\" \u2014 Kyle Kashuv (@KyleKashuv) April 19, 2018\n\nUS President Donald Trump made the cut in the Leaders category, though Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s write-up has already become a target of social media mockery.\n\nTed Cruz wrote Trump's article for the #TIME100.\n\n\n\nIt's not every day you get to pay tribute to a guy who insulted your wife and accused your dad of murder. \u2014 Nick Jack Pappas (@Pappiness) April 19, 2018\n\nMore than anything, though, the 2018 issue was politically correct. The inclusion of Fox News pundit Sean Hannity was balanced out with NBC hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt were matched by profiles of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the latter done by former US attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara.\n\nHere's my write-up of Special Counsel Mueller for TIME. #TIME100https:\/\/t.co\/GCt3K6KX5u \u2014 Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) April 19, 2018\n\nPraises were sung to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.
