{"Content":{"0":"LITTLETON, Colo. (Reuters) - Demanding an end to gun violence and tougher restrictions on firearm sales, thousands of students again walked out of classes across the United States on Friday in hopes of putting pressure on politicians ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nTimed to coincide with the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre, students left classes at midmorning, many waving placards with slogans including \u201cI should be worried about grades, not guns,\u201d and \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d\n\nOrganizers said students from more than 2,600 schools and institutions were scheduled to take part, but that was fewer than participated in a similar walkout last month.

A 13-second silence was observed in honor of the 13 killed at Columbine.\n\nAt the Texas statehouse in Austin, about 1,000 students, many waving signs and chanting anti-NRA slogans, demanded stricter gun control measures.\n\n\u201cBecause we can\u2019t vote, this is the only way we can make our voices heard,\u201d said Graeclyn Garza, a second-year student at McCallum High School in Austin, who waved a sign reading \u201cEnough.\u201d\n\nOutside the White House, protesters sat in silence while they listened to the names of gun violence victims read aloud.\n\n\u201cIt happened like 20 years ago,\u201d said Ayanna Rhodes, 14, a student at Washington International School, referring to Columbine, \u201cAnd we are still getting mass shootings in schools.\u201d\n\nTwo gunman went on a shooting rampage at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, leaving 12 students and a teacher dead before killing themselves in a massacre that stunned the nation. But since then, school shootings have become commonplace.\n\nEven as students prepared for their protest on Friday morning, news broke that a 17-year-old student had been wounded in a shooting at a high school near Ocala, Florida. A suspect was arrested soon afterward, police said.\n\nThe latest gun violence unfolded about 225 miles (360 km)northwest of the Parkland high school, where two months ago a former student killed 17 people in the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history.\n\nDespite widespread revulsion over the school shootings, the issue of gun control remains sensitive in Colorado and across the country, where the Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms.\n\nStudents gather for a rally in Washington Square Park, as part of a nationwide walk-out of classes to mark the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School mass shooting, in New York City, U.S., April 20, 2018.

He also was charged with firearms offenses.\n\nThe court delayed the ruling\u2019s effect for 60 days to allow lawmakers time to consider regulating stun guns. A spokesman for Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley, a Democrat whose office defended the law, said his office backed doing so.\n\n\u201cWe believe the current restrictions on stun guns can be updated in a manner consistent with the high court\u2019s ruling and Massachusetts\u2019 common-sense firearm legislation,\u201d said Conley\u2019s spokesman Jake Wark.\n\nRamirez\u2019s lawyer could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe ruling came amid renewed attention as to the reach of the Second Amendment after a gunman killed 17 students and staff at a Florida high school in February, prompting a surge of gun control activism by teenage students nationally.\n\nThe ruling follows an earlier 2015 decision in which the court upheld the stun gun ban in the case of a woman who was arrested for possessing one she said she carried as protection against an abusive former boyfriend.\n\nBut in 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court, in an unsigned ruling with no dissents, overturned that holding, finding it was inconsistent with a 2008 Supreme Court decision declaring an individual\u2019s right to bear arms.\n\nThe Supreme Court took issue with the Massachusetts court\u2019s finding that stun guns are \u201cunusual\u201d because they are a \u201cthoroughly modern invention,\u201d and sent the case back to the state court for further proceedings.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s ruling, Gants cited that guidance in holding that the stun gun ban was unconstitutional.\n\nHe said the state may place restrictions on who can own them, require licenses for people who possess them and restrict stun guns from being carried in schools and government buildings.","3":"(Reuters) - A Wisconsin appeals court on Thursday ruled that the daughter of a woman killed in a 2012 mass shooting can sue the operator of a firearms classified ad website from which the killer illegally bought his gun.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that a federal law that shields website operators from liability for user content did not apply to Armslist LLC, the operator of Armslist.com.\n\nArmslist was liable for its \u201cown conduct in facilitating user activity,\u201d the judges said. They referred to the site\u2019s design and operation, which allegedly promotes illegal gun sales.\n\nThe case appears to be the first in the country in which a website has been allowed to be sued over a shooting committed with a gun it helped to sell.\n\nThe Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a U.S. advocacy group for gun control that was co-counsel in the lawsuit, said other courts have interpreted the federal Communications Decency Act as broadly immunizing sites that are forums for activities like gun sales.\n\n\u201cWith one in five guns sold today without a background check - many through online sales on sites like Armslist - today\u2019s decision is a significant one toward saving lives,\u201d Kris Brown, co-president of the Brady Center, said in a statement.\n\nArmslist and its lawyer, Joshua Maggard, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit stems from a 2012 shooting at a beauty salon in Brookfield, Wisconsin.

Four other people were injured in the shooting.\n\nHaughton was able to buy his FNP-40 semiautomatic handgun and ammunition through Armslist.com although he was legally barred from purchasing a firearm at the time due to a domestic violence restraining order. The order would likely have prevented him from passing federally mandated background checks at a gun store.\n\nYasmeen Daniel, Zina Daniel\u2019s adult daughter, sued Armslist in 2015, alleging the company had acted negligently and that the website\u2019s design and account features encouraged illegal transactions.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed studies showed prohibited purchasers like Haughton are attracted to Armslist.com due to its anonymity and the fact that no account registration is required.\n\nA lower court had dismissed the lawsuit, finding that the Communications Decency Act protected Armslist from the claims.\n\nThe case is Yasmeen Daniel et al v.

REUTERS\/Andrew Cullen\n\nThis week\u2019s protests marked the second mass student walkout since a 19-year-old man opened fire at a Parkland, Florida high school in February, killing 17 people. It signalled the emergence of a growing national campaign led by young people to lessen gun violence and toughen laws on firearms sales.\n\nBut the movement faces a major early challenge as the traditional three-month summer break approaches for most U.S. public schools at a critical moment in their bid to be heard by politicians in their home states and Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cThe reason why this has been so huge (is that) we\u2019re in school, we talk to our classmates, we spread it around, everybody\u2019s around so it\u2019s kind of easier to show up,\u201d said Vivian Reynoso, 17, a junior at Tucson High Magnet School in Tucson, Arizona, who helped organise rallies for both nationwide demonstrations in the past month.\n\n\u201cOf course you fear (losing the momentum),\u201d said Reynoso, who like her peers in the campaign was born a year or more after the Columbine shootings. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure even the Parkland victims are afraid of that. That\u2019s why we need to be pushing, even if it\u2019s summer, to keep telling people to keep talking about the issue and not to forget to about it.\u201d\n\nIn the nearly two decades since Columbine seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went on a shooting rampage in 1999, killing 12 students and a teacher before committing suicide, school shootings have become almost commonplace in the United States.\n\nStudents at Columbine, which has not held classes on April 20 since the massacre, did not take part in the walkout, and were encouraged to do community service instead.\n\nEven as students prepared for Friday\u2019s protests wearing orange, the colour of the anti-gun movement, news began trickling out that a 17-year-old student had been wounded in a shooting at a high school near Ocala, Florida, some 225 miles northwest of Parkland.\n\nSECOND AMENDMENT\n\nThe debate over guns in America, where the right to bear arms is protected under the Second Amendment of the Constitution, has raged nearly since the nation\u2019s founding.\n\nThe students hope to succeed where other activists have failed in enacting stricter legislation on gun ownership, either at the state or federal level.\n\nAs anger fades over the Parkland shootings, the test for students will be in organising for gun reform. Many of the protests featured voter registration drives, with students aiming to make it a major issue for midterm elections in November.\n\n\u201cWho knows whether they maintain the energy or not but there are historic examples of student-led movements that have played an important role in moving things forward, (for example) the Civil rights movements,\u201d said Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen these kids take a real leadership role on this issue,\u201d said Winkler, author of a history of the debate over gun control in America. \u201cWhether they can sustain it not remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nThe March 24 \u201cMarch For Our Lives\u201d rallies in cities across the United States were some of the biggest U.S. youth demonstrations in decades, with hundreds of thousands of young Americans and their supporters taking to the streets.\n\nFriday\u2019s walkouts, though smaller in scale, signalled the determination of the students to press on with their movement.\n\n\u201cThe way we\u2019re viewing the summer right now is it\u2019s really an opportunity to put in a lot of work on some really big plans we have going for the return to school in August,\u201d said Gavin Pierce, 21, a college junior studying film in Los Angeles and an organizer of the \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d pro-gun control group.\n\n\u201cEveryone is really eager to keep this going and to keep on organising until we see real change,\u201d Pierce said.","7":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Two months after the death of 17 people at a school shooting in Florida sparked the strongest push for gun control in years, gun makers\u2019 stocks and firearm sales have surged.\n\nFILE PHOTO - A man fires his handgun along a mountain range in Buckeye, Arizona January 20, 2013. REUTERS\/Joshua Lott\n\nUproar over the murders continued to stoke debate about regulation ahead of November\u2019s elections, with students across the United States planning a walk-out on Friday, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre.\n\nExpectations of new regulations have sent gun owners worried about potential restrictions to stores to stock up - benefiting gun makers.\n\nThe upcoming midterm elections could boost them further, as candidates at federal and state government levels call for restrictions on the sale of AR-15s and other assault-style rifles used in recent massacres.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re getting close to the mid-terms and people perceive that there\u2019s a realistic chance that the Democrats may take the House and the Senate, that certainly could swing the industry toward higher sales because of fears of potential gun control legislation,\u201d said Rommel Dionisio, an analyst at Aegis Capital.\n\nSince the Feb 14 massacre in Parkland, Florida, prompted a movement of student activists calling for restrictions on gun sales and boycotts of companies doing business with gun makers, Sturm Ruger & Company\u2019s (RGR.N) stock has rallied 12 percent, while rival American Outdoor Brands (AOBC.O), the maker of Smith & Wesson, has jumped 4 percent.\n\nGun maker Remington filed for bankruptcy in March. It ran into trouble after borrowing to ramp up production in 2016 in anticipation of greater industry demand, according to court filings.\n\nU.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation background checks in March hit over 1.5 million, according to data supplied by the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Background checks are a strong proxy for monthly gun sales, whose figures manufacturers do not release publicly.\n\nLast month\u2019s background checks were the highest for any March since at least 2000, although they barely exceeded background checks in March 2013, when Democrats in Washington tried - and ultimately failed - to pass legislation banning assault-style weapons in the wake of a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.\n\nChecks for purchases of rifles, which are more profitable for manufacturers than handguns, accounted for much of the March increase.\n\nStill, the stock rally has not made up for a 15-month post-election slump for gun makers. American Outdoor Brands is down 60 percent from before the November 2016 election, when gun sales had been surging due to expectations that Democratic candidate Hilary Clinton would win and then impose restrictions on gun sales.\n\nSales of guns slumped after the election of Donald Trump, a Republican who campaigned against gun control. After the Parkland shooting, Trump called for age restrictions on gun purchases and stricter background checks, but later backed away from those proposals.\n\nStill, protests following the Parkland shooting have led to increased gun-control momentum in several state legislatures, and have also pushed some companies to act.\n\nBlackRock, the largest shareholder of both American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger, has pressed gun makers and retailers in its portfolios to explain how they monitor firearms sales and use. Citigroup (C.N) added restrictions on firearms sales for new retail-sector clients.\n\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods (DKS.N) has fallen 4 percent since it said on March 13 that a new policy against selling guns to people under age 21 and against selling assault style rifles and high-capacity magazines could weigh on its 2018 results. Kroger Co\u2019s (KR.N) superstore chain Fred Meyer said in March it would exit the firearms business.\n\nIn a sign that retailers have worked through excess inventory left after the 2016 election, many shops now offer product discounts of around 20 percent, down from as much as 40 percent a year ago, said Brian Rafn, lead portfolio manager at Morgan Dempsey Capital Management in Milwaukee. His firm owns shares of Sturm Ruger.\n\n\u201cThe elections will keep (regulation) in focus and keep demand simmering,\u201d Rafn said.","8":"LITTLETON, Colo.

A 13-second silence was observed in honour of the 13 killed at Columbine.\n\nAt the Texas statehouse in Austin, about 1,000 students, many waving signs and chanting anti-NRA slogans, demanded stricter gun control measures.\n\n\u201cBecause we can\u2019t vote, this is the only way we can make our voices heard,\u201d said Graeclyn Garza, a second-year student at McCallum High School in Austin, who waved a sign reading \u201cEnough.\u201d\n\nOutside the White House, protesters sat in silence while they listened to the names of gun violence victims read aloud.\n\n\u201cIt happened like 20 years ago,\u201d said Ayanna Rhodes, 14, a student at Washington International School, referring to Columbine, \u201cAnd we are still getting mass shootings in schools.\u201d\n\nTwo gunman went on a shooting rampage at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, leaving 12 students and a teacher dead before killing themselves in a massacre that stunned the nation. But since then, school shootings have become commonplace.\n\nEven as students prepared for their protest on Friday morning, news broke that a 17-year-old student had been wounded in a shooting at a high school near Ocala, Florida. A suspect was arrested soon afterward, police said.\n\nThe latest gun violence unfolded about 225 miles (360 km)northwest of the Parkland high school, where two months ago a former student killed 17 people in the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history.\n\nDespite widespread revulsion over the school shootings, the issue of gun control remains sensitive in Colorado and across the country, where the Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms.\n\nStudents hold signs during a march and rally at the Texas State Capitol demanding gun safety measures to protect schools, in Austin, Texas, U.S. April 20, 2018.

More than a month ago, tens of thousands of students from some 3,000 schools participated in the #ENOUGH National School Walkout to demand tighter gun control regulations.\n\nOn March 24, \u201cMarch For Our Lives\u201d rallies in cities across the United States were some of the biggest U.S. youth demonstrations in decades, with hundreds of thousands of young Americans and their supporters taking to the streets.\n\nOn the evening before the walk-outs, Colorado gun control activists rallied near Columbine High School.\n\nCarlos Rodriguez, a 17-year-old junior from Marjory Stoneman, travelled to Columbine for the anniversary and said he found a sense of solidarity in the outpouring of support.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s keeping us Douglas students alive right now: the distraction of fighting for our rights and advocating for our lives,\u201d Rodriguez told Reuters.\n\nSlideshow (21 Images)\n\nThere was no walkout on Friday at Columbine, which has not held classes on April 20 since the massacre.

Starbucks did not say how many hours the stores would be shuttered on May 29, but the afternoon is the slowest time for Starbucks\u2019 business.\n\nStarbucks is one of the most high-profile and beloved brands in the world and its long-time CEO Howard Schultz was not one to shy away from difficult conversations over thorny issues such as gay marriage, gun control and Congressional gridlock.\n\nHowever U.S. race relations have proven more challenging, even for a company that touts its diverse workforce \u2014 minorities account for 18 percent of Starbucks executives with the title of senior vice president or higher and 43 percent of employees overall.\n\nFor example, the company\u2019s 2015 \u201cRace Together\u201d campaign to foster a conversation on the topic following the high-profile police shootings of several unarmed black men stirred an intense social media backlash.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nJohnson has apologized for the \u201creprehensible\u201d arrests of the two men in Philadelphia on Thursday and took personal responsibility for the incident, which was captured in a customer video that was shared widely.\n\nStarbucks attorneys said Johnson and the men, who were released without charges, have \u201cengaged in constructive discussions about this issue as well as what is happening in communities across the country.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia Police late on Tuesday released the series of calls that led to their arrests.\n\nIt begins with a Starbucks employee reporting \u201ctwo gentlemen in my cafe that are refusing to make a purchase or leave.\u201d The manager who is believed to have made that call, no longer works for Starbucks.\n\nIn a subsequent call, an unidentified man said a \u201cgroup of males\u201d was \u201ccausing a disturbance\u201d that required backup and a supervisor.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s police commissioner over the weekend defended the arrests, saying his officers had to act after Starbucks employees told them the pair were trespassing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that Starbucks is giving all staff race trainings on May 29. But let\u2019s not lose sight of the real problem which is police accountability,\u201d Tiffany Dena Loftin, director of the youth and college division at NAACP, told Reuters.\n\nShares in Starbucks closed up 0.7 percent at $59.83 on Tuesday and are relatively unchanged in the week since the arrests."},"URL":{"0":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-guns\/students-to-walkout-across-the-united-states-in-call-for-gun-reforms-idUSKBN1HR1DG","1":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-guns-bumpstocks\/bump-stock-maker-slide-fire-to-stop-taking-orders-idUSKBN1HP0CR","2":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-massachusetts-stunguns\/massachusetts-top-court-declares-stun-gun-ban-unconstitutional-idUSKBN1HO2MP","3":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-guns-lawsuit\/wisconsin-court-allows-lawsuit-against-gun-sale-website-to-proceed-idUSKBN1HQ31P","4":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-filmfestival-tribeca-shootings\/u-s-mass-shooting-survivors-pay-it-forward-with-two-short-films-idUSKBN1HU1L4","5":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-guns-funds\/firearms-companies-widely-held-in-etfs-and-funds-research-firm-idUSKBN1HQ33D","6":"https:\/\/af.reuters.com\/article\/worldNews\/idAFKBN1HS0AC","7":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/usa-guns-stocks\/two-months-after-parkland-shooting-gun-makers-stocks-are-rallying-idUSL1N1RV1JH","8":"https:\/\/uk.reuters.com\/article\/uk-usa-guns\/gun-control-activists-rally-near-columbine-high-school-ahead-of-walkouts-idUKKBN1HR063","9":"https:\/\/af.reuters.com\/article\/worldNews\/idAFKBN1HR1DD","10":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-guns\/colorado-students-rally-for-voter-registration-ahead-of-anti-gun-school-walkout-idUSKBN1HQ2PR","11":"https:\/\/ca.reuters.com\/article\/topNews\/idCAKBN1HS09Z-OCATP","12":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-guns-movement\/u-s-student-anti-gun-activists-to-keep-momentum-alive-over-summer-idUSKBN1HS09Z","13":"https:\/\/uk.reuters.com\/article\/uk-philadelphia-starbucks\/starbucks-to-close-8000-u-s-stores-for-racial-bias-training-idUKKBN1HO2U9"}}
