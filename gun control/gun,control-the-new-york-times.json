{"Content":{"0":"As young survivors of the Parkland shooting lead efforts to tighten limits on firearms, they have met deep resistance from strong supporters of gun rights, and both sides have dug in. But the renewed national gun debate \u2014 reignited again after the shooting in the Nashville Waffle House \u2014 has gotten the attention of a subset of people who are often overlooked: gun control supporters who own guns.\n\nMany of these gun owners will never take part in marches or make public speeches. But interviews with two dozen gun owners around the country found what polls have shown \u2014 that many of them are firm supporters of some gun control measures. In recent weeks, some have grown more vocal, holding signs at demonstrations, lobbying lawmakers or writing letters to the editor, adding their voices to those of the protesting students.\n\nOf the 60 million to 70 million Americans who own guns, measuring how many are likely to take part in activism in favor of gun control or to change their political choices over the issue is difficult. One rough proxy for those who do not want tougher gun laws could be the five million gun owners the National Rifle Association claims as members, said Robert Spitzer, the chairman of the political science department at the State University of New York at Cortland, who has written extensively about gun policy and politics.\n\nThe N.R.A. is staunchly opposed to new gun control measures, and events following the Parkland shooting may have deepened the resolve of its supporters. In March, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the N.R.A. Political Victory Fund raised $2.35 million \u2014 the highest monthly amount raised for the fund in records dating back to 2003, according to an analysis by the news outlet McClatchy and verified by The New York Times. The N.R.A. did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nOnly a small number of gun owners seem to be stepping forward in activism in favor of stricter gun laws, and not all agree about which laws should be toughened. But advocacy groups that support increased gun control say they sense a new kind of participation in more subtle ways, such as calls from gun owners wanting to know what the groups do, and a greater willingness to listen. The shift could also have political implications: Some gun owners said they are now paying closer attention to which political candidates receive money from the N.R.A., which takes a hard line against firearm limits.\n\n","1":"Here are what students had to say as they protested across the country:\n\n\u2018I could have lost my life in that moment.\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nBrianna Lee, 17, junior at Walter Payton College Prep, Chicago\n\nBrianna Lee was 5 when she had her first terrifying brush with gun violence. Her family was returning from church one Sunday in the South Shore neighborhood of Chicago, the same enclave of bungalows and brick apartment buildings by Lake Michigan where Michelle Obama grew up.\n\n\u201cSomeone was shooting and they hit our car,\u201d Brianna said. \u201cI remember the police officer checking to see if we were O.K. Someone was hit, and he died.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could have lost my life in that moment,\u201d she added.\n\nHer family has since moved to a safer neighborhood. Brianna, whose straight A\u2019s in seventh grade helped her earn admission to Payton, one of the top-ranked public schools in Chicago, left school on Friday with hundreds of others, saying she believed elected officials were not doing enough to curb violence on the streets and in schools.\n\nPhoto\n\nThreading their way through downtown Chicago, the students walked a mile and a half to Grant Park, chanting, waving signs and attracting supportive applause from bystanders. \u201cWe\u2019re meeting up with students from other schools around the city,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hope this will make a stronger statement.

One of the guns was an AR-15. Two weeks later, at Stoneman Douglas, a former student armed with an AR-15 killed 17 people, 14 of them students.\n\n\u201cSo that just made me feel guilty inside,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cIt made me feel dirty. I shot that same gun that boy had used in Florida.\u201d\n\nAfter Parkland, she began lobbying Utah lawmakers for a \u201cred flag\u201d gun law, which would allow the police to temporarily take away guns from people deemed by a judge to be dangerous. Gracie ticked off a list of other changes she\u2019d like to see, including raising the minimum age for firearms purchases to 21 and setting limits on the amount of ammunition in magazines.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nGracie helped organize Friday\u2019s walkout at her school, which drew about 150 students to a Salt Lake City park where they wrote letters to lawmakers and made posters for a Capitol Hill rally.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are the school shooting generation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never lived in a time when there hasn\u2019t been mass shootings and so I think we\u2019re done.

It is a tribute to the service\u2019s permanent underclass, the young grunts who are too weary to feign enthusiasm anymore. (The strip\u2019s title is derived from slang for the holder of a junior rank \u2014 lance corporal \u2014 who will never be promoted and thus will depart the corps as a terminal lance.)\n\nThe Pentagon speaks of duty, commitment and national defense. Mr. Uriarte\u2019s troops seem to have boarded the wrong bus. They are anxious, lonely and bored. Sick of slogans and tired of being casually hazed and verbally abused, they take refuge in drawing penises inside the porta-potties that dot their bases and outposts. They find chaplains creepy and lifers tiresome. Their corps is a bizarre professional ecosystem where the working caste masturbates, binge-drinks, watches porn and plays video games in the barracks and then reports to work hung over.\n\nIn art as in life, it is not that these lance corporals are unwilling to train or to fight. It\u2019s that America\u2019s wars give them little opportunity to train and fight smart. Much of their deployed time is spent on duties that accomplish little, or worse, cause harm to others and themselves. In this dispiriting system the only privilege many of them can claim is the power to look down on even newer Marines \u2014 the \u201cboots,\u201d a clueless population subject to harassment and ridicule.\n\nPhoto\n\nIf this sounds like a hard sell to a proud service, \u201cTerminal Lance\u201d fans have rewarded Mr. Uriarte\u2019s unflinching take and reportage with a full embrace. The nearly 691,000 followers of the \u201cTerminal Lance\u201d Facebook page are almost four times the number of active-duty Marines. In just three years, its newer Instagram account has swelled to 287,000 fans, the largest proportion of whom are 18- to-24-year-olds. The strip\u2019s own website averages about one million unique visitors a month, and its reach is further boosted by the publication of a less offensive version in the Marine Corps Times, an independent biweekly newspaper.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Uriarte, formerly a terminal lance himself, attributes the success to an unusual trait for a comic strip: accuracy. \u201cI think \u2018Terminal Lance\u2019 has done very well because while it has been critical, it\u2019s been honest,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the strip has not generated complaints. Senior Marines often contact Mr. Uriarte to grouse about unflattering portrayals, including his characters\u2019 excessive drinking. Some try to root out his sources. But the corps and its illustrator have found a measure of peace.\n\n\u201cIf you are a grunt and can\u2019t laugh at this stuff, you\u2019d go crazy,\u201d Gen. Robert Neller, the Marine commandant, said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cEvery time I see his comic I read it. If nothing else it makes you ponder his point, or just laugh out loud.\u201d\n\nIn hindsight Mr. Uriarte\u2019s success looks like a plan. He enlisted in the Marines in 2006, when he was 19, hoping to become a professional artist with time. He had been drawing and sketching since he was kid and was seeking a challenge and the rich story lines he expected to find in grunt life.\n\n\u201cI consider myself an artist before anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cThis whole thing was really to inform my artwork, from a weird 19-year-old perspective.\u201d\n\nHe spent his first combat tour, in 2007, as a machine-gunner in the turret of an armored truck, escorting his company commander around. By his second tour, in 2009, he had talked himself into a job as an official photographer.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe next year, with only a few months left on active duty and no promotion in sight, Mr. Uriarte started \u201cTerminal Lance,\u201d publishing under his own name. He had a smartphone, a website and a subject: his fellow disgruntled Marines, who had almost no voice of their own. He channeled it.\n\n\u201cThey essentially created a monster,\u201d he said, of the corps. \u201cI wonder if they regret not promoting me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cTerminal Lance\u201d immediately attracted attention, including from a sergeant major who summoned Lance Corporal Uriarte to his office and sent him to see a Marine lawyer. The lawyer told him not to use real names \u2014 a warning he did not always heed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWhen Mr. Uriarte left the corps, he enrolled at the California College of the Arts on the G.I. Bill. He became part of a growing network of Marines attuned to problems plaguing their cohort: cycles of deployments leading to despair, post-traumatic stress disorder and difficulties readjusting to civilian life. Two members of his former infantry company committed suicide.\n\nAll of this informed \u201cTerminal Lance.\u201d Staff Sgt. Kevin T. Hoffman, a Marine based at Camp Lejeune, N.C., was drawn to Mr. Uriarte\u2019s strip as it launched, when he was a lance corporal recovering in a hospital from wounds suffered in a bomb attack in Afghanistan.\n\nHe recognized it as real. The strip resonated with him, he said, because it \u201cmade me reflect and miss the barracks and my friends.\u201d He reads it still, even as a supervisor himself. Mr. Uriarte has \u201cbeen able to remain a figurehead because his experiences are timeless,\u201d Staff Sergeant Hoffman said.\n\nOver the years the strip has come to focus on the experiences of two main characters, Abe and Garcia, who in many ways are foul-mouthed millennial updates on Willie and Joe, Bill Mauldin\u2019s comic-strip characters of World War II.\n\nGarcia is likable and reasonable, a Marine who accepts the corps\u2019 absurdities, indignities and tedium in stride. Abe is often selfish, unimpressed and eager for the weekend. He seems born not to fight, but to complain, and is not even sure why he volunteered.\n\nBut Mr. Uriarte\u2019s work has evolved past Abe\u2019s brief and often one-sided episodes of venting. In \u201cThe White Donkey,\u201d his graphic novel, he used the characters to venture into more serious themes, confronting the violence at the center of the infantry\u2019s purpose and presenting a grim view of Marines eager for war.\n\nSet in 2007 during the occupation of Iraq, it includes a scene where an Iraqi police officer stands silently beside Abe and Garcia as they talk and smoke cigarettes. Abe is disgusted. Violence has declined. He has seen little action \u2014 except for an unarmed civilian he mistook for a suicide bomber and shot. He finds Iraq ugly. He admits he hates the place.\n\nThe Iraqi officer startles the Americans by revealing he speaks English and understood everything Abe said. \u201cWould it make you feel better to kill someone?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou came here to kill brown people like me, yes? Why not kill me now?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe spares no disgust for the occupier\u2019s journey. \u201cI have met many of your type over the last few years, coming here to fulfill some personal conquest, but you never stop to think about how arrogant you are,\u201d he says. \u201cYou seek some enlightenment at the expense of my people.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Uriarte, who modeled Abe in part on his younger self, the scene is both self-lacerating and a hint of perspective gained. It is also a challenge to his core readership, as are his occasional statements on personal social media standing up for gays in the military, women in the corps and gun control.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs Mr. Uriarte works on a second graphic novel, he acknowledges that he is growing older than his subjects. He said he expects his work will eventually leave the corps behind.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to keep doing this forever,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point I\u2019ll stop.\u201d\n\nThat day does not seem soon. For now, Mr. Uriarte remains fully engaged with the corps and his illustrated version.\n\nWhen an annoyed Marine wrote to Mr. Uriarte demanding that he reveal a source behind a recent video, Mr. Uriarte did not drift into a discussion about the First Amendment or the role of anonymous sources in keeping the public informed.\n\nLike a proper terminal lance, his reply was dismissive and defiant, in keeping with what his fans might expect. \u201cYour mother,\u201d he shot back.","4":"To the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cGiuliani to Lend Legal Firepower as Trump\u2019s Team Adds Lawyers\u201d (front page, April 20):\n\nThe news that Rudolph W. Giuliani, former New York City mayor, will join President Trump\u2019s legal team to help resolve the investigation into Russian election interference is so fraught with hypocrisies that I can\u2019t stop shaking my head.\n\nWhen Mr. Giuliani was mayor I respected him not only because he reduced crime, but also because, despite his Republican Party affiliation, he supported gay rights, immigrant rights, abortion rights and gun control. Many conservative Republicans dismissed him as too liberal when he sought to run for the Senate in 2000.\n\nSadly, that Giuliani is a distant memory. He has become the ultimate mercenary, casting his fate with the most reactionary and anti-New York president in modern memory, an administration unabashedly against rights for gays, immigrants and abortion seekers and against gun control. The tax bill deliberately punished New Yorkers. Mr. Trump\u2019s active opposition to a new Hudson River rail tunnel has prevented timely initiation of an infrastructure project that is sorely needed.\n\nMr. Giuliani has truly forgotten where he came from. Shame!\n\nANDREW J. SPARBERG\n\nOCEANSIDE, N.Y.","5":"Next, churches can also enjoy the benefits of dark money. Unlike other groups, churches are required to disclose essentially nothing about who or what supplies them with their funds. And Focus on the Family, like a number of other groups on the religious right, may worry that its opposition to same-sex relationships will land it on the wrong side of anti-discrimination law. After all, the \u201cmoral behavior standards\u201d in their employee guidelines prohibit \u201chomosexual acts.\u201d\n\nThe Family Research Council, a close partner that for a time merged with Focus on the Family, is registered as a nonreligious nonprofit, rather than as a church. But one of the council\u2019s principal aims is to convert America\u2019s churches, or at least conservative ones, into partisan political cells. It seeks to place what it calls \u201cculture impact teams\u201d in churches to \u201cadvance Kingdom values in the public arena.\u201d\n\nThe way that Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council see it, the Bible offers specific information about how people ought to vote. Scripture, they say, opposes public assistance on principle (\u201cGod has charged believers to help the poor and widows and orphans,\u201d the council\u2019s culture impact team manual explains). Apparently, the Bible is also against gun control and supports privatization of schools through vouchers. It tells us that same-sex relationships are an abomination.\n\nIt does not want women to have access to comprehensive reproductive care. Environmentalism, according to the source the manual recommends to church groups, is a \u201clitany of the Green Dragon\u201d and \u201cone of the greatest threats to society and the church today.\u201d Other sources the manual recommends promote the notion that the earth is 6,000 years old.\n\nThere is no mystery about which political party the Bible supports, at least as these groups see it. In the run-up to the 2016 election, James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family and its former leader, praised Donald Trump and explained that the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency \u201cscares me to death.\u201d Their claim that they are nonpartisan is laughable.","6":"After they leave their buildings, participants will gather to observe 13 seconds of silence that are meant to honor the 13 victims in the Columbine shooting.\n\nFollowing that, further activities are up to the leaders of each school\u2019s individual protest.

In a planning guide on the National School Walkout\u2019s website, organizers encourage participants to hold marches, participate in voter-registration drives and set up speeches.\n\nWho is organizing it?\n\nThe idea for the National School Walkout came from Lane Murdock, a high school sophomore from Ridgefield, Conn., about 20 miles from Newtown, the site of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.\n\nIn the Change.org petition that Ms. Murdock started, she cited the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February as a catalyst for the event.\n\n\u201cIt is time for teenagers to speak their minds and put their frustration into action,\u201d she wrote.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Individual walkouts at schools are being organized and staged by local students.\n\nWhat are their goals?\n\nThe walkout\u2019s website says the event has three goals: to \u201chold elected officials accountable,\u201d to advocate \u201csolutions to gun violence\u201d and to encourage students to be more engaged in politics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore specifically, the event seeks to push Congress to pass legislation to halt gun violence. Among the specific requests are bills to strengthen the background check process for gun purchases; a ban on bump stock attachments, which allow semiautomatic guns to fire like automatic weapons; and raising the minimum age to purchase assault-style weapons to 21.\n\nOrganizers are also encouraging participants to pressure state and local governments to enact similar laws. They are also seeking to increase voter registration among younger Americans in the hopes of electing candidates who support gun control.\n\nDidn\u2019t we just have a walkout?\n\nOn March 14, one month after 17 people were killed in the Parkland shooting, students across the United States stepped out of their classrooms at 10 a.m. to call for stronger gun control laws.\n\nStudents left schools by the hundreds and thousands, sometimes in defiance of school administrators and school boards. In some cities, including New York, participants in the walkout then staged protests or marches.\n\nThe walkouts in March were the first major nationally coordinated action of a student-driven movement for gun control that was sparked by the Parkland shooting. Still, many students did not participate, especially in more conservative and rural parts of the country where gun control is not in wide favor.\n\nTen days later, on March 24, demonstrators gathered in Washington, D.C., for the March for Our Lives rally, as well as at more than 800 protests held around the world to call for action against gun violence.\n\nWhy is this one different?\n\nThe walkout held last month was much briefer, scheduled to last for 17 minutes, one minute to honor each of the Parkland victims. In practice, some students continued to protest for the rest of the day. This walkout on Friday is intended to last an entire school day.\n\nThe National School Walkout also comes as attention to the Parkland shooting has faded somewhat. Despite efforts by the student-driven movement, neither Congress nor the White House has taken significant action on gun control and gun safety measures. Congress did pass a spending bill in March that included measures to provide grants for school safety and to improve reporting to the background check system for gun purchases.\n\nGun regulation advocates have seen victory in Florida, three weeks after the Parkland shooting, Gov. Rick Scott signed a bill with some of the limits that students have been urging. But some have argued the legislation did not go far enough.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn their website, organizers for the National School Walkout wrote that they see their event as part of a larger push to advocate gun control and that the issues they are addressing need \u201cconstant attention if we hope to change anything.\u201d","7":"\u201cThe Westchester seat is the one where the most money and attention are being spent,\u201d said Geoff Berman, executive director of the state\u2019s Democratic Party. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing all sorts of phone banks and organizing canvassing trips from around the state to help Shelley.\u201d\n\nThe big challenge with special elections, of course, is voter turnout. Unlike the November elections, special elections can escape the notice of all but the most avid followers of politics. In the past year, more Democrats have become involved in local politics than any time in recent memory. \u201cThe Democratic base is a lot more energized since the election of President Trump,\u201d said George Picoulas, a lecturer in political science at Pace University.\n\nIn the Assembly, where Democrats have a nearly three-to-one advantage over Republicans, the nine elections on Tuesday could afford Republicans the opportunity to make inroads and the Democrats to solidify their grip. Five of the nine seats were held by Republicans, including all three on Long Island and two upstate.\n\nTwo fresh vacancies in the Assembly, resulting from two certainties of life in Albany \u2014 death and indictment \u2014 will be decided in the November election.\n\nThe three Assembly seats in New York City are expected to be filled by Democrats.

The Republican candidate, Gene DeFrancis, is a United States Navy veteran who founded a merchants association. He will face Mr. Gjonaj\u2019s former chief of staff, Nathalia Fernandez, who also worked as a Bronx representative for Mr. Cuomo.\n\nThe recent move of Brian Kavanagh, a Democrat, from the Assembly to the Senate opened up the seat in the 74th District on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where Harvey Epstein, a lawyer and former community board chairman, has the Democratic nod. He will oppose Bryan Cooper, an event planner and perennial Republican candidate.","8":"And it\u2019s important to remember that other major businesses at Goldman are also volatile. Investing and lending, which mostly involves making longer-term investments in companies, and whose revenue can be unpredictable, made up 21 percent of total revenue in the first quarter, the second largest contribution.\n\nDespite the bumper results in trading along with investing and lending, Goldman\u2019s shares slid slightly on Tuesday, suggesting investors are waiting on longer-term trends than one quarter\u2019s results.\n\nBut the volatility of revenue is not the only reason investors are often skeptical about Wall Street firms. The huge amounts that they pay out in compensation is also a concern. When revenue rises, so does pay. As a result, money that could have fallen to the bottom line at other types of companies instead gets paid out to traders and bankers. Compensation at Goldman Sachs made up 45 percent of non-interest revenue in the first quarter, up from 44 percent the first quarter of 2017.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nGoldman\u2019s profit jumps\n\nTaxes and market volatility lifted Goldman Sachs\u2019 bottom line during the first quarter.\n\nHere are the numbers:\n\n\u2014 Goldman reported earnings of $2.83 billion, up 26 percent from a year ago.\n\n\u2014 Earnings per share came in at $6.95. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $5.58 a share.\n\n\u2014 Revenue increased to $10.04 billion from $8.03 billion a year ago. Analysts had expected revenue of $8.74 billion.\n\n\u2014 Overall trading revenue rose 31 percent from a year ago.\n\n\u2014 Revenue from stock trading climbed 38 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2014 Fixed-income trading revenue increased 23 percent.\n\n\u2014 Fees from investment-banking revenue rose 5 percent to $1.79 billion, driven by an increase in underwriting revenue.\n\nPhoto\n\nStarbucks will shut 8,000 U.S. stores for racial-bias training.\n\nStarbucks said it would close more than 8,000 of its stores in the United States on May 29 to conduct racial-bias training for nearly 175,000 employees.\n\nThe move comes amid an outcry prompted by the arrests of two African-American men at a Starbucks location in Philadelphia last week.\n\nThe two men were arrested after asking to use the restroom in the shop. An employee refused their request, because the men had not bought anything, according to officials. The men sat down and were asked to leave, and an employee eventually called the police. The prosecutor\u2019s office in Philadelphia reviewed the case and declined to pursue charges against the men because of \u201ca lack of evidence that a crime was committed,\u201d according to a spokesman.\n\nTom Buerkle of Breakingviews writes that Starbucks is setting an example for corporate America: \u201cFacing a backlash over the arrest of two black men at a Philadelphia shop, the chain will shut all of its company-owned U.S. outlets for an afternoon of racial-bias education. The swift response backs up Starbucks\u2019 social goals and offers a lesson to others.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s happy hour in America\n\nSome may be optimistic that the $1.5 trillion tax cut will extend the business cycle.\n\nThe strategists at Morgan Stanley are not among them.\n\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s a fair amount of debate about how much this fiscal expansion extended the economic cycle, for markets our analysis suggests we\u2019re closer to the end of the day than the beginning. Hence, there\u2019s less reason to behave like it\u2019s \u2018morning in America\u2019 than \u2018happy hour in America.\u2019\u201d\n\nKey points\n\n\u2022 Morgan Stanley argues that while the tax cuts will help lift growth in the near term, its benefits are already priced into the markets.\n\n\u2022 The new tax law creates economic cliffs, as many key provisions in the law are not permanent and end in just a few years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 The tax cuts may make it more difficult for the government to turn to fiscal stimulus to fight the next downturn.\n\nIn conclusion\n\n\u201cWhile this policy supports growth in the near term, it may worsen the next downturn while limiting the fiscal reaction to it. Even if those concerns are unfounded, we think much of fiscal stimulus\u2019 \u2018good news\u2019 is already in the price of key markets.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHas Netflix reached escape velocity?\n\nIt was another blockbuster quarter for Netflix.\n\nThe streaming video company added 7.41 million subscribers during the first quarter. Its profit jumped 62 percent, and sales grew 40 percent.\n\nNetflix also said it plans to spend $10 billion on content and marketing this year.\n\nShares are up 8.6 percent Tuesday and 75 percent this year. That easily beats the S.&P. 500, which has gained just 0.2 percent this year. It also tops the performance of its fellow FANG stocks. Facebook is off 4.5 percent this year, Google-parent Alphabet is up about 3 percent, and Amazon has risen 28 percent.\n\nStephen Ju, an analyst over at Credit Suisse, writes in a note titled \u201cGetting Closer and Closer to Achieving Escape Velocity\u201d:\n\n\u201cNetflix continues to reap the benefits of its programming win streak, as it wields its large content acquisition budget as a weapon to put greater distance between itself and its competitors (especially as Disney prepares to exit the platform). And we find it hard to argue with the accelerated pace of subscriber additions as the conceptual proof of its capital allocation decision, and we also expect the Street to continue to underwrite the investments.\u201d\n\nAs good a day as Netflix is having...\n\nTwitter is having an even better day.\n\nIts shares are up 12 percent after a Morgan Stanley analyst upgraded the stock to equal-weight and raised its price target to $29. It is the eighth upgrade since it reported third-quarter earnings in October, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe stock is up 87 percent over that period.\n\nPhoto\n\nA \u2018Geneva Convention\u2019 for cyberwar?\n\nIn pledging not to help any government \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 with cyberattacks against \u201cinnocent civilians and enterprises,\u201d Microsoft, Facebook and 29 other tech companies are trying to distance themselves from the messy business of national cyberwarfare.\n\nThat may reassure some tech workers.
