Here's what you need to know about Friday's student-led movement:\n\nWhy is this happening Friday?\n\nApril 20 is the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Colorado, where 12 students and a teacher were killed.\n\nThat mass shooting took place 19 years ago, before today's high schoolers were even born.\n\nBut many students -- including current Columbine students -- say their lives have been shaped by sporadic school massacres, and not enough has been done to help prevent them.\n\nWhat exactly will happen Friday?\n\nAt 10 a.m. in each time zone, students will walk out and observe a moment of silence for shooting victims.\n\nWhat happens after that will be up to each school's walkout leaders.\n\nOne sample agenda suggests marching to a local lawmaker's office; allowing open-mic time for students to share concerns; and helping register those who are eligible to vote.\n\n\"For the rest of the day,\" the sample agenda reads, \"students won't return to class, but will make calls to their Senators' offices and flood social media with calls for reform.\"\n\nWho started this?\n\nShe was disturbed by her own reaction -- or lack thereof -- to the February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.\n\n\"When I found out about the shooting at MSD, I remember I didn't have a huge reaction. And because of that, I knew I needed to change myself, and we needed to change this country,\" Lane said.\n\n\"We should be horrified, and we're not anymore. It's American culture.\"\n\nWhat are the goals of this walkout?\n\n\"Empowering students to do the walkouts and become leaders in their communities, speaking up when they see inaction,\" Lane said.\n\nThe movement also encourages young people to push for legislation at the state level if Congress doesn't act.\n\n\"The federal government can set standards and practices that apply to all states around gun safety. But states have the option of passing additional measures to protect their own residents from gun violence,\" the website says.\n\nJUST WATCHED David Hogg: The people in power are shaking Replay More Videos ...

It's the second-largest shareholder in Vista Outdoor (VSTO).\n\nVanguard is the second-largest shareholder in Sturm Ruger, and the third-largest shareholder in American Outdoor Brands and Vista Outdoor.\n\nA Vanguard spokesperson said that most Vanguard funds \"do not have exposure to gun manufacturers,\" and that 359 of its 388 funds do not directly invest in Sturm Ruger, American Outdoor Brands or Vista Outdoor. Investors can also put their money in a Vanguard social fund that excludes gunmakers.\n\n\"Importantly, Vanguard is taking action, meeting with the leaders of gun manufacturers and distributors,\" the company said in a statement. \"We want to know how they will mitigate the risks that their products pose and how they plan to help prevent such tragedies from happening again.\"\n\nBlackRock declined to comment on Hogg's tweets, but pointed to the action the company has taken in recent months on gun issues.\n\nEarlier this month, BlackRock said it will start offering gun-free retirement funds in response to consumer demand, as well as additional funds that do not include gun stocks. The company has also engaged in policy discussions with weapons manufacturers and distributors.\n\nRelated: BlackRock is launching gun-free funds for retirement plans\n\nHogg previously helped lead the charge against a number of companies with ties to the National Rifle Association, including FedEx (FDX) and Hertz (HTZ).\n\nIn recent weeks, Hogg spearheaded a push for advertisers to boycott Fox News host Laura Ingraham's show, after she mocked him for not getting into several colleges.

But, as the Ridgefield High School sophomore sat in front of her laptop, with Benny Goodman playing on her portable turntable, it must have felt as though no fortification could ever protect a generation growing up in the age of the active shooter.\n\n\"That America's children are growing up in fear is something we're not talking about,\" said Lane, who recently turned 16. \"No child should have to learn how to hide from a shooter.\"\n\nThat night, Lane came up with a plan for students to walk out of school in protest on Friday, April 20, the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.\n\n\"I thought, originally, it would just be my school but, obviously, it's grown,\" she said.\n\nIndeed, more than 2,500 schools from New England to Hawaii were expected to participate, along with American students at Oxford and Cambridge universities in England and high schoolers in the US island territory of Guam.\n\nLane tweeted a photo of students at the walkout Friday afternoon.\n\n\"The work we have done today is beyond anything I thought I would ever see.

It was expected to be the biggest walkout since March 14, when scores of students across the United States walked out of class to honor the Parkland victims and to make sure calls for change account for the broad context of gun violence.\n\n\"If you can't vote, you don't have a lot of concrete power,\" Lane said. \"As a student, what do you have? What you have is your attendance in school, ... and there's power to that.\n\n\"Hey, if we can disrupt the national schedule of kids going to school and draw attention to this issue,\" she said, \"then that's a step closer to change.\"\n\n'We should be horrified, and we're not'\n\nIt wasn't so much the February 14 massacre at Stoneman Douglas but the absence in her community of any profound response to it that gave root to Lane's mission.\n\nAfter a former student sprayed the Parkland, Florida, campus with a semiautomatic rifle , news alerts flashed on smartphones in Ridgefield, some 1,300 miles away. Then, everything just went back to normal.\n\n\"I remember I didn't have a huge reaction,\" Lane recalled. \"And because of that, I needed to change myself, and we needed to change this country. We should be horrified, and we're not anymore.\"\n\nAs classes drew to a close that afternoon, the principal addressed students over an intercom. She talked about school safety and asked for a moment of silence for the Florida victims.\n\n\"Then she said, 'At the end of the day, it's up to you guys,'\" said Lane, who took that to mean students -- rather than adults -- held responsibility for curbing the school shooting epidemic. \"It kind of annoyed me. It was up to them to change this, and they haven't. That infuriated me.\"\n\nSo, Lane thought, \"OK, if it's up to us, watch us.\"\n\nAs she wrote, Jimi Hendrix's stare from a poster on her wall gave her inspiration, Lane said.\n\n\"I'm very into symbolism,\" she said, \"so I took that as a sign.\"\n\nLane and other Ridgefield students soon formed what would become the first chapter of the National School Walkout movement. In late March, she and others walked out of a school board meeting when it appeared officials would not support the walkout. The board relented.\n\nNow, the group's Twitter account has 131,000 followers, and its sharp website offers a social media tool kit and other materials to help students join the cause.\n\nMore than 150 member chapters have formed around the country.\n\nThe movement, Lane said, is about \"empowering students\" to fight against federal and state government inaction on gun violence. It encourages young people to push for solutions that range from banning assault weapons to mandating universal background checks for gun buyers to allowing families to petition courts to remove guns from people at risk of hurting themselves or others, according to the walkout website\n\n\"It is not conservative or liberal,\" she said. \"It's about making sure children don't get harmed in school and we don't live in a country that has institutionalized fear.\"\n\n'This is the event of your life'\n\nLane and some of her classmates took to the streets March 24, for the national March for Our Lives demonstration in Washington, which was organized by young survivors-turned-activists from Parkland. Lane met some of them, along with teens who live with gun violence daily in cities such as Washington, Baltimore and Pittsburgh.\n\n\"There are kids ... who don't have the platform that I have, who haven't gotten the media attention they deserve,\" said Lane, whose mother is from Texas and father is from Puerto Rico. \"I do come from a position of privilege, and I have the time and resources to do something like this.\"\n\nLast week, on the warm, last day of spring break, her walkout chapter's members met at the Ridgefield rec center.\n\n\"I showed up a little late. I'm sorry,\" Lane told a small group of student leaders sitting behind Macs and notebooks.\n\n\"We understand. You're a celebrity,\" 17-year-old Paul Kim joked.\n\n\"And only a little over 16,\" teased Josh Burns, 16.\n\nThey discussed logistics: security for the walkout, tables for a voter registration drive and for writing letters to elected officials, food and water donations, the sound system, the guest speakers.\n\nLane Murdock, 16, discusses logistics with classmates a week ahead of Friday's National School Walkout.\n\n\"Student speakers, sometimes they're boring,\" said Paul, a senior. \"Just off the top of my head, I can't really think of someone that I really want to see speak.\"\n\n\"That we don't have a lot of outside speakers is actually going to be a good thing,\" said Lane, who wears a small \"I will vote\" button. \"It's about us.\"\n\nJunior Grant Yaun, 17, called the walkout \"a coming-of-age moment\" for his generation.\n\nAnnie Colao, 18, said she wasn't \"patting myself on the back\" for being there during spring break but actually \"feeling guilty for not having stepped up\" against gun violence sooner.\n\n\"This fight does not stop after April 20,\" Lane said. \"This is the event of your life. Be sure to communicate it that way.\"\n\n'This is a lockdown drill'\n\nThe walkout has become a huge undertaking for Lane, who sometimes rises at 5 a.m. to respond to emails and phones calls. Then, she goes to class all day before juggling school work, event organizing and a couple media interviews in the evenings.\n\nLane's father, who works in telecommunications, helps his daughter with scheduling and fielding all the inquiries. He also drives her to appointments. But mostly, he said, he stays out of her business.\n\n\"She's always been her own person -- even since she was little,\" Paul Murdock said. \"It's been all her.\"\n\nAlso long part of her life have been active shooter drills, which she recently lamented as a fixture since first grade.\n\n\"It's muscle memory for a lot of us,\" she said. \"I can even recite it from memory: 'This is a lockdown drill. In the event of an actual emergency further instructions will be provided.' A teacher turns off the lights. Closes the door. Shut the blinds. ... It's built into us.\"\n\nLane was in fifth grade in 2012, when a young man shot and killed 26 people -- including 20 children -- at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, less than 20 miles away.\n\n\"I remember going home and seeing Mom crying,\" she said. \"Sandy Hook was the first school shooting we can remember. Then, there were many more others.\"\n\nHarking back to that tragedy, Lane said Friday's walkout is about ending the scourge of school shootings before another generation of American children grows numb to it all -- and about speaking for those whose lives it already has claimed.\n\n\"Of course, we're a generation that's passionate about gun control,\" she said. \"We've lived this. A lot of the kids who attended Sandy Hook would be in high school now. We kind of symbolize these children who would have been our age.\"","8":"(CNN) Take a look at the week in politics from April 15 through April 21.\n\nFormer President George W.

Scott Beigel saved her life, she said -- he unlocked the door of the room to let her hide inside. He didn't make it in himself.\n\nTwo weeks later, she returned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. She trembled and looked over her shoulder. Her breaths were short. She didn't feel safe.\n\nShe missed Mr. Beigel. He was the only teacher who made her care about school, the 16-year-old freshman said.\n\nShe said she cried through that morning. When she got home, she picked up the phone, but she hesitated -- she didn't want to cry over the phone. Still, she dialed.\n\nAfter a few rings, Mr. Beigel's mother picked up.\n\n'We can keep in touch through Scott'\n\nLinda Beigel Schulman, 63, and her son had a routine: He called her every day after school.\n\nA week after he died, Kelsey came to his funeral. The teenager told his family how much Mr. Beigel meant to her. She said she had thought about him every day since he died.\n\nKelsey and Shulman were so moved, meeting each other, that they said \"I love you\" as they parted ways.\n\nThey ran into each other four days later, as they waited off camera for a live interview near the campus.\n\n\"Kelsey, I'm going to miss him terribly, also,\" Schulman remembered saying. \"He called me every day. But you know what, if you want, you can call me, and we can keep in touch through Scott.\"\n\nKelsey said she was glad she'd have a chance to maintain a connection with Mr. Beigel. \"I'd do anything to keep his memory alive,\" she said.\n\nAnd if Schulman can help Kelsey through this time in her life, she said, she's doing what her son would have wanted. \"It's just a continuation of Scott,\" she said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Shooting survivor thanks mom of fallen teacher Replay More Videos ...

For Schulman, the conversations have become a wonderful part of difficult days. She feels like she has gained an adopted daughter, she said.\n\nSince the day of the funeral, whenever they talk or text, they always end by saying \"I love you.\"\n\n\"I consider her a mom. She's family,\" said Kelsey, who calls Schulman \"Mrs. Beigel.\" \"Her whole family is family.\"\n\n'I heard the shot that killed him'\n\nWhen Scott Beigel, 35, called his mother, he'd often talk about life -- his dog Murphy, his workout routines, his lesson plans and goals for class. He was getting more confident as the months went by, his mother remembered, and he was looking forward to the next school year. He felt like he was finally reaching his students.\n\nIn class with Mr. Beigel, Kelsey remembers laughing at his corny jokes. It surprised her that they liked the same music -- \"Feel It Still\" by the band Portugal. The Man.\n\nBefore high school, she struggled academically. But Mr. Beigel taught geography in a way that made her understand, and made the subject matter to her. \"I loved going to school when I had him,\" she said.\n\n\"She felt that he cared,\" said Kelsey's mother, Sheila Friend.\n\nWhen shots rang out at Stoneman Douglas on February 14, Kelsey turned to Beigel for help.\n\n\"I said, 'I'm scared, I don't know what's going on,'\" she told CNN shortly after the shooting. \"Then he unlocked the door, I ran in, and unfortunately, he did not run in with me.\"\n\n\"I heard the shot that killed him,\" she said. \"Remembering that bang, it haunts me.\"\n\n'Scott's a hero'\n\nFor years, Schulman was a single parent.

They called their talks \"positive venting.\" \"No havtahs,\" she would always say -- meaning he shouldn't call out of obligation.\n\nHe always called, particularly since Schulman's father died last year at age 87.\n\n\"I could go to Scott with anything.

He called his wife at work and asked her the name of their son's school.\n\n\"Do you know that there was a school shooting in Florida?\" he said. She didn't.\n\nShe found the school's name and sent her son a text message. He didn't answer.\n\nShe tried not to worry. On the news, she heard that a geography teacher and cross-country coach was among the victims. Questions raced through her mind.\n\nWhat hospital would he be in? Did he have his wallet?\n\nSchulman, her husband and her brother flew to Florida, arriving late that night. At a command center, they learned there were still some unidentified victims among the 17 dead teachers and students.\n\nSix hours later, an officer approached her. \"Scott's a hero,\" she remembered him saying.\n\n\"But he didn't make it,\" another officer said.\n\n'He was her hero that day and even before'\n\nImmediately after the shooting, Kelsey called Beigel a hero in interviews.\n\n\"I will never forget the actions that he took for me and for fellow students in the classroom,\" she told CNN then.\n\n\"If his family is watching this,\" she said, voice cracking as she looked into the camera, \"please know that your son, or your brother, was an amazing person, and I am alive today because of him.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Student gives tearful tribute to slain teacher Replay More Videos ...

She threw her arms around her. She thanked Kelsey for keeping her brother's name alive, and letting the world know what kind of person he was.\n\nIn an interview, Zech said the world knew her brother was a hero. \"What's even more important is that he was her hero that day and even before,\" she said.\n\nShe said it touched her when Kelsey called her brother \"my Superman\" in an article in The Washington Post.\n\nHer brother was her Superman, too, Zech said.\n\nAnd her Superman was shot on her birthday.\n\n'We'll get through this'\n\nOn that day after Kelsey had returned to school in February, something told her to call Schulman, she said.\n\n\"I' want to believe it was Mr. Beigel guiding me,\" Kelsey said.\n\nShe told Schulman about her day. She said she was having trouble getting out of bed in the mornings. She was scared and upset Mr. Beigel had died.\n\nHe wouldn't want her to be upset, Schulman told her. He would want her to focus on school and graduate.\n\n\"We'll get through this,\" she told Kelsey.\n\nKelsey held it together; she didn't cry.\n\nIn another phone call, Kelsey told Schulman about the new teacher who took Beigel's place.\n\n\"I miss Mr. Beigel so much. It's really hard,\" Schulman recalled her saying.\n\nSchulman, a former teacher, told Kelsey to think of the jitters she felt at the start of school. Her new geography teacher was probably scared, too.\n\n\"Believe it or not, Mr. Beigel was scared, too,\" Schulman said.\n\n\"So you need to give him a chance, just the way you gave Mr. Beigel a chance.\"\n\n\"OK, I'll try,\" Kelsey responded.\n\n\"She's right,\" she remembered thinking after the conversation. \"I just have to give him some time.\"\n\n'Mr. Beigel wants you to keep living'\n\nKelsey and Schulman have coped with their grief in different ways. Schulman fields a barrage of phone calls each day working on a memorial fund in her son's name. And she has emerged as an activist.\n\n\"I'm dipping my toe in everything right now to find the place where I want to give most of my time for gun control,\" she said.\n\nBut for 20 minutes in her mornings, she sits in silence at home while she does her makeup and thinks about her son. It's 20 minutes of raw reality. She calls it her \"Scott time.\"\n\n\"I give myself those 20 minutes a day, and when I'm done, I put my mirror away, I take a breath, and I go about my day,\" Schulman said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kelsey has struggled to return to class. She has been to school one to two times a week, mostly leaving after lunch time. One night, she had a nightmare that it was February 14 again, and she got shot at school. Loud sounds take her right back to the terror of the shooting, her mother said.\n\nWhen Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade visited Stoneman Douglas in March, some of the other students screamed with excitement, but Kelsey flashed back to the screams she heard on that awful day. Another time, she hid when she heard the banging sound of a classmate shaking the vending machine.\n\nHer mother has bribed her to attend class with the promise of a virtual reality game. She tries to comfort her, but struggles to find words that might ease the pain.\n\nShe said she is willing to try anything to make her daughter feel better.\n\n\"If it's talking to Mr. Beigel's mom, then that's what it will be, because that's what God's putting in her path,\" she said.\n\n\"The more people that love my kid, the better it is,\" Friend said.\n\nIn March, the Friends briefly met Schulman in Washington at the March for Our Lives, a rally for stricter gun laws organized in response to the Parkland shooting.\n\n\"You need to try to get back to classes -- I know it is super hard but Mr. Beigel wants you to keep living life,\" Schulman wrote in a text to Kelsey afterward.\n\n'Nothing will keep me away'\n\nThree days later, Kelsey sent Schulman a picture of a new tattoo on her ankle. It was the school's mascot -- an eagle -- with its wings folded around a red ribbon that read \"MSD Strong, 2-14-18.\"\n\n\"Is that your tattoo?\" Schulman wrote.\n\n\"Yes. It's crying two teardrops. For Mr. Beigel and my friend Peter ,\" she wrote. Peter Wang, a 15-year-old JROTC cadet, was among the victims.\n\nThe tattoo on her ankle reminded her that \"they're here with me no matter what,\" she said.\n\nSchulman said she won't allow Kelsey to be miserable and that she tries to end their conversations on an upbeat tone. That's important, for both of them.\n\n\"She's healing me a little bit more, taking away a little bit of the pain,\" Kelsey said.\n\n\"Would you go to my graduation if I saved you a seat?\" Kelsey asked Schulman in a phone call this month.\n\n\"If you send me an invitation, nothing will keep me away,\" Schulman replied."},"URL":{"0":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/23\/politics\/ohio-john-kasich-gun-control\/index.html","1":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/22\/politics\/david-briley-waffle-house-shooting-tennessee\/index.html","2":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/us\/live-news\/national-school-walkout\/index.html","3":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/19\/us\/dicks-sporting-goods-guns-trnd\/index.html","4":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/19\/politics\/obama-parkland-students-time-100\/index.html","5":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/19\/us\/national-school-walkout-explainer\/index.html","6":"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/17\/news\/companies\/david-hogg-vanguard-blackrock-boycott\/index.html","7":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/19\/us\/national-school-walkout-organizer-lane-murdock\/index.html","8":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/21\/politics\/cnnphotos-week-in-politics-0422\/index.html","9":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/18\/us\/parkland-mom-student-friendship\/index.html"}}
