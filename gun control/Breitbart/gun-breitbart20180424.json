{"Content":{"0":"There are a lot of gun terms thrown around in the media these days, like \u201cclip,\u201d \u201ccasings,\u201d and \u201csemi-automatic.\u201d But if you\u2019re not familiar with firearms, many of these terms might go over your head. This glossary of common gun lingo will help clear things up so you can be an informed part of the conversation.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, this is a sensitive subject, especially in light of the many recent tragedies that have occurred. But knowledge on the subject of guns is important\u2014no matter where you stand on the matter\u2014since misinformation does nothing but cause more confusion and frustration for everyone. Real discussion can only occur when we all understand the basic facts.\n\n\n\nIn alphabetical order, these are the gun terms you may not know:\n\nACP : An abbreviation of Automatic Colt Pistol. Designates various John Browning cartridge designs and calibers primarily used in Colt and Fabrique Nationale de Herstal semi-automatic pistols, like .45 ACP, .380 ACP, and .25 ACP.\n\n\n\n: An abbreviation of Automatic Colt Pistol.

AK-47 : An incredibly popular automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov, and first used in active service back in 1948. They are very reliable and cost very little to make so they\u2019re the gun of choice for many military and revolutionary outfits. As of 2004, \u201cOf the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov family, three-quarters of which are AK-47s\u201d\n\n\n\n: An incredibly popular automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov, and first used in active service back in 1948.

My life was fulfilled.\u201d\n\nRajneesh, who died in 1990, was a powerful spiritual guru who had thousands of followers in India and the West. In 1981, with the help of Sheela, who became his personal assistant, Rajneesh bought a ranch nearby the tiny town of Antelope, Oregon, and moved his cult there, creating a whole new city named Rajneeshpuram. It\u2019s no surprise that the situation snowballed, leading to heated confrontations with local residents, attempted murder, and mass poisoning. Wild Wild Country follows the saga in captivating ways, through historical footage as well as sit-down interviews with Sheela, who effectively ran the cult and was Rajneesh\u2019s spokesperson, and other members who had prominent roles, like Rajneesh\u2019s lawyer Swami Prem Niren.\n\nBut as Ronit Feinglass Plank notes in The Atlantic, the series doesn\u2019t really explain what the day-to-day life was like in Rajneeshpuram. And it doesn\u2019t really address how it\u2019s possible that thousands of people could just give up their lives, wear only maroon clothes, and blindly follow one man. What are the psychological mechanisms at play?\n\nRajneesh preached to his followers about the idea of creating awakened people who live in harmony with their surroundings. But his cult also forced members to donate large quantities of money, while creating an isolated community that kept tight control over its members. The Netflix documentary doesn\u2019t show this, but Win McCormack, who wrote about the cult in the 1980s, points out in The New Republic that Rajneesh\u2019s followers were encouraged to get sterilized or have abortions. (For more on Rajneesh and his cult, read The Oregonian\u2019s 20-part investigation from the 1980s.)\n\nRajneesh was just one of many cult leaders who have captivated \u2014 and horrified \u2014 people throughout history. In 1978, cult leader Jim Jones urged more than 900 of his followers to kill themselves by drinking poison in Jonestown, Guyana. In 1993, in a standoff with government officials, more than 75 Branch Davidians died in a building fire in Waco, Texas, together with their leader David Koresh. All of these groups, and many more less prominent cult organizations, have some things in common. I talked with Louis Manza, chair and professor of psychology at Lebanon Valley College about how cult leaders control their followers, when people are most vulnerable to cults, and the difference between cults and religions.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nHow do cult leaders like Rajneesh exert control over their followers?\n\nThey can take a lot of approaches, obviously. On a real simple level, they could take control in a very physical way, restraining someone from leaving a space, but that doesn\u2019t seem to happen a whole lot. It\u2019s more of a psychological control. If you look historically at different types of cults, there\u2019s always an indoctrination period where the cult leader is going to form a bond with people. Once they have that bond, now they can get inside of someone\u2019s head, because now those people start to trust that person. And now the leader can start to make other suggestions to them: \u201cYou should move away from your family.\u201d \u201cYou should come live with us.\u201d Etc. That\u2019s one of the critical things: there has to be that emotional connection that\u2019s made by the person who\u2019s running everything with the people they want to bring in with them. If you don\u2019t have that connection, it\u2019s going to be really hard to get people to do anything.\n\nWhat kinds of psychological mechanisms do cults use to keep their members in line?\n\nOnce someone forms a bond with a person, you can use that to your advantage, to a certain extent. You can withhold certain types of things. If you\u2019re the cult leader, [you can decide] we all get to meet at this point in time, and we all get to talk about our feelings, but you can\u2019t come this week because you\u2019ve been misbehaving, or you\u2019re not been pulling your share, or whatever the case might be. Once you have that relationship with that person, punishing [or rewarding] them can get something out of them. Again, it\u2019s not a physical-restraint type of thing, but it is a form of control.\n\nThey\u2019re also paying attention to what works, the same way that a spouse pays attention to what works with their significant other, the same way a parent pays attention with their kids. [Parents] can punish their children by making them stand in a corner for 10 minutes, and that works because that kid doesn\u2019t like to stand in a corner. But for another kid, that doesn\u2019t work, so they have to find something else. So they take the tablet away from them, or they don\u2019t let them watch television. People who are very good at understanding other people, are very good at paying attention, can get inside someone\u2019s head and then exploit that. But the person who\u2019s exploited has to be exploitable. If someone is in a good place psychologically, then they\u2019re most likely not going to be exploitable.\n\n\u201cPeople who are very good at understanding other people, are very good at paying attention, can get inside someone\u2019s head and then exploit that.\u201d\n\nWhen are people most vulnerable to a cult?\n\nOn a simple level, when they\u2019re in a state of psychological instability \u2014 if something is not quite right in their life, if they\u2019re missing something, especially on a relationship perspective. We are social creatures. There\u2019s going to be some variability there; some people like much larger social circles than others, some people like to live in a cabin in the woods by themselves. But the majority of us fall in the middle. It\u2019s part of what makes us humans. And so if that\u2019s missing for individuals, and they don\u2019t have a way of meeting that need on their own, they\u2019re going to look for someone else who can maybe provide that need for them. Now, lots of people will join \u201ccults\u201d as a way of satisfying that. Other people will join other types of groups.\n\nI compete in ultramarathons, so I do a couple races a year. And that kind of satisfies that need for me. Now, is that a cult? I don\u2019t think so, not in a way we define a cult, when you think of like the Jonestown massacre and Jim Jones. If you\u2019re into certain sports teams, that social need is being met there. It\u2019s just that idea that someone needs some type of social connection. I think it\u2019s one of the primary forces. If they simply can\u2019t find a way on their own to fulfill that, and then someone comes along and says, \u201cHey, we have this group. And you\u2019re welcome. Join us!\u201d it can be a very subtle thing at first. If you want to get someone in, and you know how to manipulate people, it\u2019s fairly simple to do: you bring them in, you establish the relationship, and then you just start sucking them in more and more, and eventually, someone just crosses a line and they\u2019re in. And then they can have a hard time getting out, because now they have that social need being met. It can be a very subtle process along those lines.\n\nWhat do cult leaders have in common?\n\nThey tend to be charismatic. Historically, if you think of the people we call cult leaders, like David Koresh, James Jones, they all had a certain charisma. That goes back to what I was saying about forming social bonds. If you can\u2019t attract people to you, then you\u2019re going to be hard-pressed to form a cult. Beyond that, it\u2019s going to depend. You have to understand people, you gotta know what\u2019s going on inside of their heads, you gotta talk to them, you gotta be able to pull information out of them. Those are skills. All of us use them in different ways. I\u2019ve been teaching since 1992, so I know if I do this, I will get students to interact in class. Is that a form of manipulation? Sure it is. I wouldn\u2019t put it up with the same kind of manipulation that a cult leader is doing, but they are also doing that. They\u2019re understanding people, they\u2019re studying people. They develop that kind of skill-set, but I think charisma has to be at the top of it, because just knowing people, it\u2019s a skill people can acquire. Being charismatic and understanding people, that\u2019s another thing altogether.\n\nPeople who are in power also like to keep that power, and they don\u2019t want to give that power up. The cult leader wants to control people, to a certain degree. When you look at people who run these organizations, if you look at the more historically famous ones, they had a need to control people, and when that control got pushed up against, they pushed back. When David Koresh and the Branch Davidians went down, Koresh didn\u2019t want to give up control of those people. And you had the gun fight and the burning of a building and all that. Jim Jones didn\u2019t want give up control of those hundreds of people in Jonestown, and people died. I think wanting to control is a driving force from the leader, and wanting to belong is the driving force for the member. You put those things together, you create the perfect storm for getting people into a cult.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a cult and a religion?\n\nReligions are an organized belief system, and cults are organized belief systems. People will engage in lots of behaviors on the part of their religion, that can be very good but it can also be very bad. People have killed other individuals in the name of their religion. Now, will Catholics prevent you from leaving the church? Not to my knowledge. I was raised Catholic. I\u2019m an atheist now. Now one held me back. So what we usually consider cults tend to exert a bit more control over their members, but that\u2019s not to say that that control doesn\u2019t happen in more organized, traditional religions. But with cults, you see that real psychological, physical-restraint thing kick in to a much higher degree than you see in Catholics, Lutherans, or whatever. If there is a dividing line, it\u2019s along those lines, but they definitely share a lot of features, because they\u2019re organized belief systems.\n\nBut there are lot of things that are not even religions or cults that are organized belief systems. Again, if you\u2019re part of a certain sports team, you have an organized belief system. But mental manipulation, psychological manipulation is something you tend to see more in cults than in organized religion.","2":"There are few gambles in the tech world as big spending billions to build a new computer processor from scratch. Former AMD board member Robert Palmer supposedly compared it to Russian roulette: \u201cYou put a gun to your head, pull the trigger, and find out four years later if you blew your brains out.\u201d Six years ago AMD loaded the gun and pulled the trigger, dramatically restructuring itself internally in a mad bid to escape a disaster of its own making. Now we\u2019ve seen the results and instead of dying, AMD has a savvy new CPU microarchitecture, Zen, that\u2019s the foundation of the shockingly good new series of Ryzen processors. They\u2019re so good, in fact, that they could pose a real challenge to Intel\u2019s incumbent dominance and change what the computer market looks for the next few years.\n\n\u201cI think Intel kind of woke up and said \u2018hey you know we\u2019re in a battle all of a sudden,\u2019\u201d Linley Gwenapp, an analyst, and editor of the Microprocessor Report, an industry magazine, told Gizmodo. \u201cSo they\u2019re not going to just stand by and let AMD storm into the market.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Intel has its work cut out for it. In January at CES in Las Vegas, I met with both companies and the mood could not have been more different. Intel seemed to spend the entire consumer electronics show apologizing for Spectre and Meltdown, a series of catastrophic security vulnerabilities that affected every one of the company\u2019s CPUs. It seemed to barely have time to tease all the cool stuff it had coming out in the next few months. AMD, meanwhile, was a peacock\u2014fluttering its feathers and bragging about its plans to continue one of the most aggressive launches in CPU history. The fact that it was vulnerable to Meltdown was almost an aside. AMD was way too busy being thrilled to be back, doing something very cool, and not being the one with all the bad press for once.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s been very successful when you look at where they were a year ago,\u201d Gwenapp said of AMD. Because even just a year ago the company was in rough shape. According to Gwenapp, AMD had as little as 1.5 percent of the server market share last year. Intel had the other 98.5 percent. Sure it was making the chips that power every single Xbox One and PS4, and yes it\u2019s the exclusive provider of GPUs for Apple machines, but to anyone who was paying attention, it sure seemed like AMD was a shadow of its former self. After all, the company was once considered Intel\u2019s only serious rival in the CPU space, and until Zen was announced, AMD had been virtually silent on that front, effectively capitulating the multi-billion market for the chips that serve as the brains for everything from your computer to the servers powering your favorite websites.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Gizmodo\n\nAMD\u2019s last big push in the CPU space came with a microarchitecture called Bulldozer back in 2011. In the tech world that\u2019s an eternity. To put it in perspective, the same year AMD was last seriously attempting to compete with Intel, Apple launched the iPhone 4s, and Intel launched the second generation of its Core architecture. Intel is now on generation eight and expected to launch its ninth by the end of the year. It\u2019s been eons since Intel and AMD were serious competitors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the biggest reasons it\u2019s taken so long for AMD to compete again is because that last big CPU launch was disastrous. Bulldozer obviously wasn\u2019t intended to be awful. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as if somebody architected something that people thought wouldn\u2019t be successful,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, Founder and Prinicipal Anaylyst at Moorhead Strategy, told Gizmodo. Before becoming an analyst, Moorhead was a VP at AMD for nearly 10 years and departed at the same time Bulldozer came to market.\n\nAccording to Moorhead, Bulldozer was always intended to be a high octane kind of CPU that blazed past its Intel competitors thanks to its high clock rate (or clockspeed). The higher the clockspeed the more cycles of processing a CPU can potentially undergo in a second, and according to Moorhead, AMD had planned a clock rate of 5GHz, which is over five billion processes every second. Intel\u2019s competitor at the time shipped CPUs with a much lower clockrate\u2014only a handful could hit 4GHz.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why when people say \u2018oh we didn\u2019t get out of Bulldozer what we would have wanted\u2019 it\u2019s because that was supposed to be a very high frequency part,\u201d Moorhead said. In fact no CPU in general production from AMD or Intel has ever hit a clockrate of 5Ghz or higher. The only CPU to ever go into production with such a high clockrate is the IBM zEC12 released in 2012 and intended solely for IBM mainframes.\n\n\u201cIt was never really competitive.\u201d\n\nWhen Bulldozer went into production it had a base clockrate of just 4.2GHz with a turbo clock rate (which is enabled when the processor needs to crank through a little data very quickly) of 4.5GHz. And the respectable clock rate couldn\u2019t compete with Intel\u2019s offerings in the same space. The reaction from reviewers was brutal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnandtech\u2019s Anand Lal Shimpi wrote that he was \u201cnot sure it\u2019s quite ready for prime time\u201d and that \u201cBulldozer simply does not perform.\u201d Tom\u2019s Hardware noted that it was often \u201cembarrassingly bested by its predecessor\u201d while Tweaktown lamented that \u201cyou can\u2019t help but almost feel disappointed with what\u2019s going on here today.\u201d\n\nWhen CNET did a round up of the geekier reviews of Bulldozer it reported that \u201cBulldozer does not appear to offer AMD a competitive resurgence.\u201d But it was at least a little hopeful AMD could stick around in the CPU space, if for no other reason than \u201cto keep Intel honest.\u201d\n\nYet that didn\u2019t happen. AMD had come out of the gate with a troubled architecture and the gap between it and Intel only grew wider over each successive annual iteration. The company tried \u201cto start with something that doesn\u2019t work well and then kludge it up to make it better,\u201d Gwenapp told Gizmodo. But with each new iteration based on the already underperforming Bulldozer architecture it couldn\u2019t keep up. \u201cIt never really was competitive.\u201d\n\nIt takes guts\n\nAnd a CPU absolutely must be competitive\u2014either cheaper, faster, or more power efficient. It is the core brain that powers every computer you use\u2014from your phone to your laptop to your TV. A CPU defined by its microprocessor\u2014which is in many cases a synonym for CPU. It\u2019s a wafer of silicon that then has billions of microcircuits etched to its surface and connected to one another via ions of copper. The specific way a CPU\u2019s silicon microcircuits\u2014or transistors\u2014are arranged and connected via copper is called its \u201carchitecture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe very first microprocessor, the Intel 4004 released in 1971, was built on a die, or foundation, that was just 10,000nm. That is as thick as a very thin strand of human hair. The Ryzen CPU is just 14nm. A small process means it can move energy across those copper ions faster\u2014effectively meaning that the smaller a CPU gets the faster it can be. But the smaller a CPU is the more delicate it becomes. So in the bid to make the fastest and most powerful processors, CPU designers must also make them smaller and more intricate. And that means always optimizing and seeking better efficiencies.\n\nConsequently each CPU is designed for a specific \u201cinstruction set.\u201d That is the most basic code that works between a CPU and a devices software. Common CPU instruction sets you\u2019ve heard of are ARM and x86. ARM CPUs are usually found in phones and tablets\u2014the CPUs that power you Samsung GalaxyS9 and your iPhone X are ARM-based processors. x86 CPUs are usually reserved for computing devices that need a lot more power and a little less battery life. Intel and AMD\u2019s CPUs for laptops, desktops, and servers are x86, and unless specifically specified, as are AMD\u2019s competitors, including its new batch of Ryzen processors.\n\nBeyond the instruction set CPUs, are actually pretty simple and just made up of a few key components: cores, CPU caches, and the system bus. The cores are the engine of the CPU, they\u2019re the things doing all the actual processing and when you talk about the clockrate of a CPU you\u2019re talking about how fast those cores are operating. The cores do all the actual processing required by the CPU, but they\u2019re very busy processing all that data you feed them, so they need to cache bits of it away for super quick references.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is where CPU caches come in. They are the memory. When you glance at the specs for a computer you\u2019re planning to buy you might see a mention of these caches, usually labelled L1, L2, and L3. They\u2019re important because they\u2019re what the cores actually read and write data to while processing. That data, after being processed on the CPU caches, is then sent back out to the general memory (also known as RAM) for the computer, and then possibly onto the storage drive, and it all gets to your eyeballs because it goes through the graphics processing unit.\n\nThe CPU caches and the cores communicate to one another via the system bus. It\u2019s called a bus because it\u2019s essentially busing information from one part of the CPU to another. And sometimes it\u2019s not just moving data between the cores and the CPU caches. A system bus will also move data to and from a graphics processor if its squeezed onto the same chip too. At its most rudimentary, consider a system bus to be like that little green board you used to snap all the Lego bricks onto.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are a lot of different kinds of system buses, and every major CPU maker has their own system bus architecture. So Intel has what it calls Front Side Bus, and until Zen, AMD used tech called HyperTransport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, focusing on any one of these components can improve the speed of a CPU,. When AMD created Bulldozer it put all its effort into the clockrate of the cores of the CPU. The clockrate is the frequency at which a computer processing unit can actually process cycles of data. More processes means a faster CPU and for a very long time improving the clockrate of a CPU was the primary goal of designers.\n\nBut in the early 2000s, Intel brought a CPU to market with a clockrate of 3GHz, and since then nearly all CPUs have hovered around that clockrate. One of the reasons for that stall in clockrate increases is because the higher the clockrate the more heat the CPU produces. Getting rid of all that heat can be costly\u2014especially if you\u2019re trying to pack that CPU into something super slim and fanless like a Surface Pro.\n\nSo in recent years, CPU designers have turned other parts of the CPU to improve speed, and when AMD made the decision to essentially scrap Bulldozer and put most of its resources into what would be come Zen, one particular component of the CPU would get a brunt of the focus: A new system bus architecture called Infinity Fabric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut before AMD settled on Infinity Fabric, before it even settled on creating a new CPU and acknowledging Bulldozer\u2019s failure, the company needed a new CPU design team.\n\nPhoto: Alex Cranz (Gizmodo)\n\nTheir powers combined\n\nEnter Mark Papermaster, current Chief Technology Officer for AMD. He joined the company in late 2011, just after Bulldozer\u2019s launch, and according to him \u201cit was not a coincidence.\u201d Papermaster had been brought in to help save a company that saw its stock prices plummet more than 60-percent in a year thanks in part to Bulldozer\u2019s poor performance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore joining AMD Papermaster was primarily noteworthy for two things. In 2008 he was the subject of a highly publicized lawsuit with IBM, where he\u2019d worked since 1982. IBM was concerned that Papermaster, then a recent hire at Apple, would potentially carry trade secrets with him from IBM to Apple. The case settled out of court. Then Papermaster made headlines again in 2010, when he reportedly left Apple after just 15 months due to disagreements with then CEO Steve Jobs.\n\nPapermaster entered AMD in October 2011 and the company seemed to be in a state of free fall, with major rivals like Qualcomm, Apple, and Samsung snapping up dissatisfied employees. The flight of employees struck a nerve with some. \u201cThat just breaks my heart,\u201d former AMD founder Jerry Sanders told Forbes in February 2012.\n\nThe company was in disarray and Papermaster was himself contributing to it. Not because of his previous reputation, but because one of his first orders of business was to dramatically restructure the CPU design team. He\u2019d seen how bad Bulldozer was doing and it was clear to him it wasn\u2019t the processor AMD needed to succeed. \u201cI saw the market going to high performance,\u201d he told Gizmodo. \u201cTo do that we needed a new CPU.\u201d Instead of something that could just handle your web browsing, Papermaster was certain the market needed something that could handle gaming, or processing huge 3D files, or rendering big 4K videos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for Papermaster, a new CPU meant a major restructuring of AMD\u2019s design group. Traditionally the CPU design group was was broken up into two basic teams. \u201cPrior to the Zen architecture they really had two kind of parallel design tracks,\u201d Natalie Jerger, a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, told Gizmodo. One processor was intended for low powered laptops and desktops\u2014the cheapest of the cheap. The other was intended for servers and high end desktops. The server class processors were Bulldozer, and the low power CPUs were what was called the Bobcat family.\n\n\u201cAnd so what [Papermaster] did was he merged these two teams together,\u201d Joe Macri, Corporate Vice President and Product CTO at AMD, told Gizmodo. Macri was one of the leaders of that new, larger team.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo hear him tell it, the merging of the two teams (and the removal of anyone made redundant) seemed like a necessity for the task Papermaster assigned to the larger group. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to start from scratch,\u201d Macri said. \u201cSo that was really more of a merge than taking an existing team, rip it apart, and put it back together. But in the process we got a lot of efficiencies. We were able to apply more people to a single function and get much more design bandwidth.\u201d Bandwidth that would be necessary to accomplish Papermaster\u2019s goal of building a CPU that was in every way better than that rubbish it had just released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPapermaster was soon aided by another new exec at AMD: Lisa Su, who joined as Senior Vice President and General Manager in January 2012. Su had come from Freescale, another CPU maker that has since merged with NXP Semiconductors. Her first focus was on AMD\u2019s graphics and gaming markets\u2014where the company was actually having some successes. Su and then CEO Rory Read, secured deals with both Sony and Microsoft to create the chips at the heart of the Playstation 4 and Xbox One.\n\nThose deals were enormous, and many sources cite AMD\u2019s work on custom chips for Sony and Microsoft as one of the reasons the company both survived the CPU drought and actually managed to produce such an effective CPU with its current architecture, Zen.\n\nSu\u2019s work earned her quick notice and by October of 2014, a little more than two years after she\u2019d joined AMD, she was elevated to CEO. Su and Papermaster then proceeded to pour resources into the development of Zen. According to Macri it was over two million man hours spread over four years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Papermaster, putting all those resources into a new CPU design, and having that team effectively ignore Bulldozer and its successive iterations, was absolutely vital. He needed a team that would have the breathing room \u201cto get those bright ideas that they had.\u201d He felt that some of AMD\u2019s coolest ideas for new CPUs \u201chad been on the shelf because there had been such a demanding schedule of new revision after new revision.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou know sometimes you can get a \u2018let\u2019s do a from scratch design and throw everything out.\u2019 The team didn\u2019t do that.\u201d Instead the team pulled from AMD\u2019s extensive back catalog to use ideas that hadn\u2019t been given a lot of focus over the years. One such idea was improving on the system bus architecture HyperTransport and creating a new one: Infinity Fabric.\n\n\n\nMark Papermaster told Gizmodo AMD called it \u201cthe hidden gem,\u201d while Jim Anderson told Gizmodo it was the \u201csecret sauce.\u201d\n\nMr. Infinity\n\nThis is where a talented engineer named Jim Keller comes in. He\u2019s a mythical sort of figure within AMD. Nearly every person I spoke to cited Keller as one of the primary people behind the success of Zen\u2019s design, and importantly behind the design of Infinity Fabric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPapermaster hired Keller in 2012 and put him in charge of the processor group. Keller was no stranger to AMD. He\u2019d worked there previously in the \u201890s and his short tenure had achieved legendary status in the geeky processor community online where he is credited as the principal figure behind AMD\u2019s K8 microarchitecture which allowed the company to be viciously competitive with Intel in the late \u201890s and early 2000s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeller and Papermaster had worked at Apple together, where Keller is credited with designing the first CPUs Apple built itself for its iPhones and iPads. When he came to AMD, both he and his new employer agreed to come under a limited time contract. He would work at AMD for three years, and at the end of that contract he would depart, which he did in 2015. He now designs chips for the autopilot feature in Tesla\u2019s cars, and declined to comment for this story. [Update: The morning of publication, Intel announced that Jim Keller had jointed the company as the SVP for Silicon Engineering. The plot thickens!]\n\nKeller, and in particular his work on mobile CPUs and previous work on HyperTransport, were key. Without Keller to speak for himself we\u2019re left with glowing praise from AMD execs like Mark Papermaster and Jim Anderson, and from analysts like Linley Gwenapp who said \u201cI think Jim and his team really has turned around the company from a technology standpoint.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a rare public interview in 2014 with Papermaster, you start to get a sense of Keller\u2019s enthusiasm and motivation. \u201cI joined AMD because I love processor design and I love complicated systems design and AMD was looking at taking a big swing on the next generation,\u201d Keller said.\n\nKeller seems calm and polished up on the little stage, but he tends to ramp up in response to geekier questions\u2014growing sharper and more and more animated as he talks about architectures and pipelines and cores and the other supremely technical stuff that most of us would yawn at.\n\nThe interview is a great look at where Zen was in 2014\u2014three years before its launch. At the time it was only approximately two years into its development, and still being designed alongside K12\u2014AMD\u2019s planned next generation ARM CPU. In the interview, Keller actually cites that co-development as an asset to Zen and specifically to the cores at the heart of each Zen CPU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever Keller doesn\u2019t hint at the most important component until near the end of the 15 minute session when he mentions a next generation \u201cfabric\u201d that would be found in every CPU from mobile devices up to servers and that would allow AMD to scale performance at an enviable rate. That fabric would be known, by 2017, as Infinity Fabric.\n\n\u201cAMD has found a way to have their cake and eat it too.\u201d\n\nHe explains that the fabric would allow AMD to employ a \u201cchiplet\u201d approach to design. Instead of building one processor on a single die AMD could package a series of processors together\u2014connecting them via the Infinity Fabric system bus. This would make the CPUs way cheaper to produce and ideally as fast as a CPU, like AMD\u2019s previous CPUs and most of the ones from Intel, that included all the cores on a one die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHistorically,\u201d analyst Patrick Moorhead told Gizmodo, \u201cwhen you put things in packages it slows down the process. But AMD has found a way to have their cake and eat it too by coming up with this packaging that sets very high performance.\u201d\n\nAnd this packaging also meant AMD was designing a very different kind of CPU from its competitor, with a different, and according to AMD, much more efficient methodology. \u201cWe came up with a very regular structure for it,\u201d Joe Macri told Gizmodo. \u201cWe basically had a data point and a control point and everybody that bolted into [Infinity Fabric] bolted into it the same way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMacri claims Infinity Fabric actually sped up design of the processors across the board. The modular design it gave the Zen architecture meant AMD didn\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel for every kind of CPU. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges in designing a core is actually validating it,\u201d Macri said. And thanks to Infinity Fabric AMD could quickly validate, or confirm the operation of, a whole slew of slightly varied designs ranging across their entire offering of Zen processors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink of Infinity Fabric as the little snaps in Lego blocks and all the components of a CPU as the blocks themselves. AMD could take a few blocks to build a desktop CPU, or tack on more to create a big multi-core server processor, or snap on a GPU to make a wicked fast chip intended for laptops.\n\nOr, as happened in 2016\u2014an entirely new type of CPU for AMD.\n\nImage: Gizmodo\n\nThe breakthrough\n\nReleased in 2017, Threadripper\u2014AMD\u2019s perhaps most eye catching CPU launched on Zen\u2014was never on any of Papermaster\u2019s aggressive roadmaps. Instead it was a passion project by a very small group of engineers\u2014like maybe four. A \u201cvery, very small group,\u201d Robert Hallock, AMD Evangelist for APUs and CPUs said. He shared the same row of cubicles with them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company had wanted to do a really big and powerful desktop CPU for a while, but it had never been feasible technologically or financially speaking. Yet this tiny group of engineers realized that they could potentially take advantage of the chiplet design made possible by Infinity Fabric to build an incredibly powerful desktop CPU to rival Intel\u2019s popular top-end Xeon CPUs. Yet instead of the 8 cores found on the Xeon processors used in beefy workstations, the Threadripper would have a whopping 16 cores\u2014the most ever put in a mass-produced desktop CPU.\n\nSuch a CPU should take years to design, test, and push into the market place right? According to Jim Anderson the tiny team didn\u2019t even approach him about it until January 2016, when they pulled him aside during CES in Las Vegas. He said he immediately recognized the sheer cool factor of these chips and insisted on putting the project on a fast track, taking it from their concept to production in just a little over a year.\n\nThe project was steeped in secrecy, referred to only as Summit P3\u2014which many assumed was a minor offshoot of Ryzen\u2014then call Summit Ridge, and according to Hallock \u201cyou were not even allowed to send emails\u201d about the project. Everything, from the look to the speed results were closely guarded until launch and even the teams trying to convince PC makers like Dell to adopt the CPU had almost no details on the product itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet when Threadripper did finally launch in the summer of 2017, it shocked critics and consumers alike, and was quickly adopted by some of the largest PC makers in the world, including Alienware\u2019s top-of-the-line gaming desktops.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the audacity of Threadripper\u2019s design that intrigued people. Yes 16 cores running 32 threads in a desktop PC anyone can build is impressive, but Intel announced an 18-core i9 processor just two weeks after Threadripper was announced. What was surprising was that it was cheap\u2014$1,000 to the $2,000 for Intel\u2019s 18-core processor\u2014and the damn thing was actually as fast.\n\nPhoto: Gizmodo\n\nMore than anything else, this is what has surprised observers about AMD\u2019s latest CPU architecture: The chips are cheaper and usually faster than their Intel competition. You can look at our own reviews of AMD processors over the last year as proof (here, here, and here).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet AMD isn\u2019t just producing fast, cheap processors processors, it\u2019s also releasing them all of a sudden at a surprisingly fast clip. In 2017 AMD released four categories of CPUs based on Zen: Ryzen desktop CPUs, Threadripper, Epyc CPUs intended for servers, and Ryzen APUs for laptops (APU is the AMD term for a CPU with integrated graphics). We\u2019re only four months into 2018 and AMD has already released incredibly fast and cheap APUs for the desktop, additional mobile APUs for laptops, and even a second generation of Ryzen CPUs for desktops.\n\nJim Anderson told Gizmodo he anticipates over 60 new laptops and desktops with Ryzen inside by the end of the year, with most of those systems being laptops, and most of those laptops coming in the next few months. \u201cThis will be the widest range of premium notebook systems that you\u2019ve ever seen from AMD in the company\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nHow good those laptops are remains to be seen. So far there are only a handful of AMD-based laptops actually in the marketplace, and we still don\u2019t have a good sense of how well a mobile Zen processor handles power compared to its Intel rival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if it\u2019s not quite as good at power management, it\u2019s still okay. Because Intel has clearly noticed AMD\u2019s strides into the CPU space and has responded accordingly. Last year Intel\u2019s top of the line desktop CPU maxed out at 4 cores, but after AMD released a 6-core processor Intel quickly responded with its own 6-core device. And when AMD surprised us with the 16-core Threadripper, Intel raced to get the 18-core i9 into the marketplace.\n\nA rivalry between the two companies can only ever be good for all of us hunting for our next computer. \u201cYou know,\u201d Natalie Jerger told Gizmodo, \u201cthe the world is much more exciting if we have multiple people trying to innovate in this space.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis post has been updated to reflect that former AMD-engineer Jim Keller has moved on to Intel from Tesla.","3":"As young survivors of the Parkland shooting lead efforts to tighten limits on firearms, they have met deep resistance from strong supporters of gun rights, and both sides have dug in. But the renewed national gun debate \u2014 reignited again after the shooting in the Nashville Waffle House \u2014 has gotten the attention of a subset of people who are often overlooked: gun control supporters who own guns.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany of these gun owners will never take part in marches or make public speeches. But interviews with two dozen gun owners around the country found what polls have shown \u2014 that many of them are firm supporters of some gun control measures. In recent weeks, some have grown more vocal, holding signs at demonstrations, lobbying lawmakers or writing letters to the editor, adding their voices to those of the protesting students.\n\nOf the 60 million to 70 million Americans who own guns, measuring how many are likely to take part in activism in favor of gun control or to change their political choices over the issue is difficult. One rough proxy for those who do not want tougher gun laws could be the five million gun owners the National Rifle Association claims as members, said Robert Spitzer, the chairman of the political science department at the State University of New York at Cortland, who has written extensively about gun policy and politics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe N.R.A. is staunchly opposed to new gun control measures, and events following the Parkland shooting may have deepened the resolve of its supporters. In March, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the N.R.A. Political Victory Fund raised $2.35 million \u2014 the highest monthly amount raised for the fund in records dating back to 2003, according to an analysis by the news outlet McClatchy and verified by The New York Times. The N.R.A. did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nOnly a small number of gun owners seem to be stepping forward in activism in favor of stricter gun laws, and not all agree about which laws should be toughened. But advocacy groups that support increased gun control say they sense a new kind of participation in more subtle ways, such as calls from gun owners wanting to know what the groups do, and a greater willingness to listen. The shift could also have political implications: Some gun owners said they are now paying closer attention to which political candidates receive money from the N.R.A., which takes a hard line against firearm limits.\n\n\n\nAfter the Parkland shooting, Lindsey Donovan, an Army veteran in Georgia who is a member of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said she began getting calls and inquiries from distant corners of that state, including gun shop owners in tiny towns \u201cwanting to talk about what it is we are about.\u201d Conversations about gun restrictions with friends in the military, she said, seemed to grow more searching and less combative.\n\n\u201cThey are not shutting me down anymore,\u201d Ms. Donovan said.\n\nBefore Parkland, her organization in Georgia had five local groups. Now there are 12. Around 1,800 people showed up to the organization\u2019s annual advocacy day in Atlanta in late February, up from 150 last year. And local chapter meetings used to draw around 30 people on any given night. Now it\u2019s often more than 100 showing up.\n\nDr. Spitzer said gun owners who favor gun limits reflect an often-silent middle who could be powerful allies for gun control groups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dog that doesn\u2019t bark,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a voice that\u2019s not heard.\u201d\n\nLong before Parkland, he said, gun owners who are not members of the N.R.A. have tended to see things differently than members. A 2009 survey by Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, found that 30 percent of N.R.A. members supported a ban on assault weapons, compared with 47 percent of gun owners who were not members \u2014 closer to the views of the general public in such polls.\n\nSurvey data has long shown gun owners to be broadly supportive of some restrictions on firearms. Polling just after the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland suggested a small uptick in support for stronger gun laws in gun-owning households. A poll by Quinnipiac University between Feb. 16 and 19 found that 50 percent of respondents in gun-owning households supported stricter gun laws \u2014 a figure that was seven percentage points higher than when people were asked the same question last December. In February, 97 percent of respondents in gun-owning households said they supported background checks for all gun buyers, compared with 94 percent in December. (The 1994 Brady Bill created a requirement for gun buyers to pass a background check, but the rule does not apply to private sellers online or at gun shows.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Before long, 61 gun owners in the state, including Mr. Galinat, had signed on to a letter to lawmakers, urging them to expand background checks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an ardent advocate for the Second Amendment, and none of those gun safety measures threaten any of those things that I believe in,\u201d said Mr. Galinat, who also went to Montpelier for a news conference on the issue. He said his only quibble with the letter, which was written by the consultant and a local gun safety group, was that he wanted lawmakers to set even stronger gun limits.\n\nSome gun owners said the Parkland shooting motivated them to be more vocal about their support for background checks, or about long simmering discontent with the N.R.A.\n\n\u201cWhat put me over the edge was this series of recent tragedies, both in schools and in other areas, and they just never budged,\u201d John S. Liccardi said of the N.R.A. Mr. Liccardi, 73, a hunter from Rutland, Vt., who owns several guns, stepped publicly into the gun debate for the first time in March. He denounced the N.R.A. in an op-ed for the news website VTDigger.\n\n\u201cIf there ever is going to be any progress in sensible gun ownership and control,\u201d Mr. Liccardi said, \u201cit has to be from the middle ground.\u201d\n\nSome members of gun-owning families have entered the debate hesitantly. Karen Fowkes from Vienna, Va., joined a sea of people at the March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C., last month. Her husband owned a gun, she said, and she initially worried about feeling hypocritical, but joined her daughter, Colleen, at the march after some convincing.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Mom, this is not an anti-gun march,\u2019\u201d the younger Ms. Fowkes said. \u201cI asked, \u2018Are you for universal background checks?\u2019 She said, \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo that, the younger Ms. Fowkes told her mother, \u201cYou are for gun control, too!\u201d\n\nBut for other gun owners, the marches had the opposite effect.\n\n\u201cI have a little bit more trepidation now,\u201d said Rob Mason, 47, an educational aide at a high school in Maineville, Ohio, outside Cincinnati, who owns several guns and practices shooting with his children at a range. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s going too far.\u201d\n\nMr. Mason, who is not an N.R.A. member, said he supports universal background checks. But he is uncomfortable with the notion of an assault-rifle ban. His daughter, Grace, who is 16, went to a march in Ohio. He was proud she participated. But he also felt worried. The marchers\u2019 demands seemed fluid and ill-defined, raising the worry that the young people simply wanted to ban all guns.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAs a moderate, I\u2019m like, \u2018Hmmm, are they really just pushing for one type of gun to be banned, or are they pushing for everything?\u2019\u201d Mr. Mason said. \u201cThe protesters are not talking to me. I don\u2019t think they believe that there are people like me out there.\u201d","4":"On platforms and devices, software and apps, the emoji keyboard is a gun-free zone. Well, almost.\n\nOn Wednesday, Google rolled out an Android update for the emoji keyboard that replaces the gun emoji with a \"toy water pistol.\" And according to Emojipedia, a similar change is imminent on Facebook.\n\nSEE ALSO: Apple is replacing the pistol emoji with a bright green squirt gun\n\nApple (via Unicode), Samsung, Twitter, and WhatsApp for Android have also all previously replaced guns with toy water pistols.\n\nEmojipedia reports that in the past, Google hedged on the change. But it has also emphasized its desire to be consistent with other platforms. That \"consistency\" is surely what drove this change \u2014 definitely not the gun control movement which has literally taken over the country in the wake of February's Parkland, FL shooting.\n\nIn 2016 when I asked if Google planned to change their gun emoji to a water pistol, the answer was \"we'll see\". Implied: we'll change ours, if or when others change theirs. And now they have. https:\/\/t.co\/lKzrMoSNys pic.twitter.com\/KGTlFLmOn9 \u2014 Jeremy Burge (@jeremyburge) April 24, 2018\n\nGoogle and Facebook's switch leaves one major player still with a straightforward, and not \"playful\" gun emoji option. That's Microsoft, on its Windows devices. Interestingly, though, Microsoft initially had a \"ray gun\" as its gun option. It only switched to a pistol in 2016 \u2014 the same year that Apple opted for a water gun option.\n\nAre toy guns much better tho? Just saying. Image: emojipedia\n\nRidding emoji keyboards of guns may sound like a trivial move in the effort to end gun violence \u2014 and it was a decision that certainly would irked some gun rights advocates. But with emoji more and more defining the way we speak to each other, and with the evidence that words and images impact the way that we actually think and act in the world, taking a gun out of our visual lexicon may be a more powerful act than it seems.","5":"Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) Bless your soul, Mick Mulvaney, for spelling out so clearly and succinctly the evil that drives Washington. As the former congressman and now interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau explained to bankers on Tuesday, \"We had a hierarchy in my office in Congress. If you're a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn't talk to you. If you're a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.\" Yes, Mulvaney would also meet his constituents from back home, whom he insists were at the top of the hierarchy.\n\nAmerica is a pay-to-play political system. When the lobbyists pay up, they're at the table. And to be sure, the big boys now run the show. The result is a political system among the most corrupt in the world, but with a twist of genius: the US Supreme Court has for all intents and purposes legalized the corruption and thereby put American democracy on a downward death spiral. The system works like this.\n\nAmerica's business interests, upper classes and white population have long made it hard for the poor and working class to register to vote. In most other democracies , voter registration is not the responsibility of individual voters, but is more or less automatic. Unlike these other democracies, US elections are a game of voter turnout, not of substance.\n\nAnd voter turnout efforts are based heavily on money -- big money -- to run ads on TV and other media, buy voter data, manage expensive targeting of households, and other big-ticket strategies. The 2016 federal election cycle saw at least $6.4 billion spent on federal campaigns, and that's not counting the anonymous corporate sums that are not reported.\n\nCongressmen live and breathe for campaign funds, and also to avoid crossing the interests of powerful corporate lobbies that might fund a primary challenger. The result is that billionaires and powerful companies own and operate the US political system. The vulgarity of the US situation would shock Karl Marx, who famously described 19th century democracy as a system in which \"the oppressed are allowed every few years to decide which particular representatives of the oppressing class are to represent and repress them.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Warren to Mulvaney: You're hurting real people Replay More Videos ...

In Citizens United, the Supreme Court basically gutted any control over corruption by eliminating nearly all restrictions on independent campaign spending by corporations, on the grounds that such restrictions violate the \"free speech\" guarantee of the First Amendment.\n\nA system that was already corrupt up to the gills suddenly was essentially told, officially and at the highest level, that American democracy was hereafter being turned over to the highest bidder. Evidently, Mulvaney knew well how to play the game, as he was showered with largesse from the financial industry\n\nThe Roberts Court is certainly one of the shoddiest in American history. It followed up the Citizens United decision with McDonnell v. United States, declaring, in effect, that the blatant corruption of former Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell and his wife could be seen merely as a politician interacting normally with his constituents. McDonnell, duly convicted of bribery earlier by a jury of his peers, walked free after the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn Citizens United, the court offered the following stunning claims: \"We now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. ...

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. The Insider Pick: If you style your hair daily with a blow dryer or curling iron, your hair needs protection from heat damage. The Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray will protect your hair from heat damage without weighing it down, keep frizz at bay, and give you silky hair at an extremely affordable price. If you use any type of heat styling tool on your hair \u2014 whether it\u2019s a hair dryer, curling iron, or hair straightener \u2014 a heat protectant is a must-have! Exposing your hair to any type of heat without applying a protectant first is like laying out in the sun without any sunscreen. It may not be super noticeable at first, but the consequences won\u2019t be pretty. Without a properly applied protectant, heat will dry out your hair, making it brittle and prone to breakage. To find the heat protectant that's best suited to your hair type, there are a few things you should consider. The most important factor is your hair type. You may find that one kind of protectant works better for you than another. If you have fine or frizz-prone hair, you\u2019ll want a protectant that will smooth flyaways without weighing down your strands. If you have hair that is already prone to damage, look for a protectant that provides maximum protection of up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. If you have thick hair, a protectant that can be applied to wet hair is ideal so all that volume can soak up the product. Knowing how you want to style your hair can also help you decide which heat protectant will best serve you. Heat protection should be applied at the very beginning of your styling routine. If you just plan on blow drying your hair, a conditioning protection mist may be all you need. If you plan on using a hair straightener, using a protectant that will help smooth your hair and create shine will make styling easier. For a wavy or curly style, a protectant that provides texture, volume, and hold can help you achieve curls that won\u2019t go limp after a couple of hours. We did the research and read the reviews to find the best heat protectant sprays that cost less than $25. For this guide, we chose to go with heat protectant sprays because they\u2019re versatile, and there are plenty to choose from depending on what type of style you\u2019d like to achieve. Sprays provide even coverage, and when used properly, they won\u2019t weigh hair down.

It comes as no surprise that the Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray has received consistently positive reviews from buyers. It costs less than $10 and holds its own among the more expensive options of heat protectants. It\u2019s a hair product that works, and unlike many heat protectants, its light formula won\u2019t weigh hair down. Tresemme's spray makes hair soft, shiny, and manageable. Most importantly, it lives up to its name by protecting your hair against heat damage so you can blow dry, straighten, or curl to your heart\u2019s content. This spray is infused with vitamins to help your hair continue to look and feel healthy after you\u2019re done styling. It\u2019s also versatile: You can apply it to wet hair before drying \u2014 a must to ensure total heat protection \u2014 and you can also apply it to dry hair before straightening or curling. While it\u2019s an excellent heat protectant, be aware that this formula doesn\u2019t provide any hold, so if you are curling your hair, you\u2019ll want to layer it with another product. Since it has a lightweight formula, it can be layered with other products without your hair feeling greasy or weighed down. Experts agree. In its review, Allure praises this Tresemme heat protectant for being \u201clight as a feather\u201d on hair, and for the spray gun style nozzle that \u201ccovers hair quickly and evenly.\u201d As with any hair product, for the best results, you\u2019ll need to follow the instructions on the packaging. For this heat protectant, it\u2019s advised to spray 6 to 8 inches away from your head, from mid-shaft to the ends of your hair. For the most thorough heat protection, you should use on your hair while its wet, before drying, and then again if you\u2019re using additional heat styling tools once it\u2019s dry. Some reviewers did have trouble with the nozzle breaking or not spraying properly, but most found the spray function easy to use, and appreciated the lock and unlock function on the nozzle. Those with fine hair and with thick hair have had good luck with this product. Another plus? According to buyers like Ren, \u201cIt smells great, and works with my hair!\u201d Often it can be hard to find an effective hair product without an overpowering smell. Reviewer Jen-Nar\u2019s statement sums up why the Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer is our top pick: \u201cThis is the best thermal protector spray out there for the price.\u201d Pros: Lightweight formula won\u2019t weigh down hair, infused with vitamins to enhance hair health, pleasant scent, can be used on wet or dry hair, affordable Cons: Doesn\u2019t provide hold for curly or wavy styles, some reviewers had trouble with the nozzle breaking or not spraying properly Buy the Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray on Amazon for $4.48 Buy the Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray at Walmart for $4.48\n\nThe best heat protectant for hair straightening Why you'll love it: The HSI Professional Argan Oil Heat Protector will protect your hair from temperatures up to 450 degrees, thanks to nourishing oil. It comes as no surprise that the makers of the best-selling hair straightener on Amazon also have an effective heat protectant that\u2019s the number one seller in hair sprays. The HSI Professional Heat Protector is infused with antioxidant-rich argan oil to make your hair sleek and shiny. Most importantly, it creates a protective barrier against heat styling tools. If you blow dry and straighten your hair often, this heat protectant will help keep your hair healthy. Even if you aren\u2019t using heat styling tools every day, this heat protectant can also work as a leave-in conditioner to create a frizz-free look. It\u2019s sulfate, paraben, and phosphate free so it can also be used on color treated hair and even human hair extensions. While the HSI Professional Heat Protector can work with any heat styling tool to protect your hair, its high heat protection and infusion of argan oil make it ideal if you want to straighten your hair \u2014 especially if it\u2019s naturally very curly. The argan oil will smooth and get rid of frizz, while the heat protection of up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit will allow you to use higher heat settings if needed. You may equate anything with oil in it to be heavy, but this heat protectant still manages to have a weightless feel while protecting your hair and infusing it with moisture. This makes it ideal for straightening both fine and thick hair. It can be applied to wet or dry hair for styling. If you are starting with wet hair, you should apply before using a blow dryer to provide full coverage against heat damage. Some reviewers did find the smell of this hair protectant too strong. On the upside, those that found the scent to be strong do note that the product itself does work well. Other reviewers are complete converts, loving the way their hair looks, feels, and smells after using it. Reviewer Karina loves that it \u201cgets all those stubborn little hairs in place\u201d and \u201cmakes the straightening job much easier.\u201d Pros: Heat resistant up to 450 degrees, infused with argan oil for a sleek look and frizz control, weightless feel, can be used on wet and dry hair Cons: Some reviewers didn\u2019t like the scent Buy the HSI Professional Argan Oil Heat Protector on Amazon for $6.95 to $14.99\n\nThe best heat protectant for curling Why you'll love it: The Matrix Biolage Thermal Active Setting Spray provides heat protection as well as light hold for long-lasting curls and waves that won\u2019t feel stiff or crunchy. Hair products that serve a dual purpose make for a great addition to your style routine, saving you time and money. If you curl your hair often, a heat protectant that provides both protection against heat and hold to keep your style in place is definitely worth considering. The Matrix Thermal Active Setting Spray does both, and won\u2019t leave your hair feeling stiff or crunchy like some hairsprays tend to do. It will also add volume and shine, so your hairstyle won\u2019t go limp and dull halfway through the day. It\u2019s happened to the best of us, but getting up early to style your hair is a wasted effort if your style doesn\u2019t last. This is a non-aerosol spray that can be applied to both wet and dry hair. You can apply a layer before blow drying for thermal protection. Then, apply another layer to hair once it\u2019s dry before you start using any other heat styling tools to provide extra hold. If you have fine, naturally straight hair that typically doesn\u2019t hold curl very well, you're in luck with this spray. Reviewer Meagan says this is \u201cthe only product that works on my straight hair to hold curl. It doesn\u2019t leave sticky residue like other products I\u2019ve tried.\u201d In addition to providing hold, volume, and shine this protectant will also help control frizz and flyaways. While it works great with curling irons and hot curlers, it can also be used with a hair straightener or just a blow dryer for a frizz-free style that stays in place and has extra shine. Some reviewers did experience stickiness after using this product and felt that it coated their hair too heavily. As with most hair products, hair type and user application do influence the effectiveness of a heat protectant. With hair products that provide any sort of hold, it\u2019s important to remember that a little goes a long way. Start with the minimal amount of product, and only add more as needed, otherwise, you can easily end up with stiff, greasy feeling hair. Most reviewers are happy they tried the Matrix Biolage Thermal Active Setting Spray, loving that it helps fine hair hold curl, keeps frizz at bay, and that their hair stays in place without feeling too heavy. Pros: Provides soft hold for curly and wavy hairstyles, adds volume and shine, can be used on wet or dry hair Cons: Some reviewers experienced stickiness after using it, and felt the formula was too heavy Buy the Matrix Biolage Thermal Active Setting Spray on Amazon for $13.58\n\nThe best heat protectant for fine hair Why you'll love it: The Kenra Thermal Styling Spray 19 provides thermal protection up to 428 degrees, will tame frizz and flyaways, and has a truly weightless formula ideal for fine hair. It can be easy for fine hair to get weighed down with product, becoming greasy and limp. While this may deter you from wanting to put a heat protectant in your hair and start styling right away, you should really use one. Fine hair can also be easily damaged and is prone to breakage, so if you\u2019re using heat styling tools without any protectant, you\u2019ll be putting your hair at risk. Luckily, there are hair products designed for fine hair, like the Kenra Thermal Styling Spray. The non-sticking formula will protect your hair from heat, but won\u2019t leave any residue behind. It provides a clean and easy release from curling irons and hair straighteners that will minimize breakage. It\u2019s weightless, but does provide just enough control to tame any frizz or flyaways, and will add shine to any hairstyle. This spray also provides light hold for use with curling irons and hair straighteners alike, giving your curls bounce, or keeping your hair pin straight all day depending on which style you decide to go with. This is a styling spray, so it\u2019s meant to be applied to dry hair right before using a curling iron or hair straightener. If you\u2019re starting with wet hair, you\u2019ll want to apply a heat protectant designed to be used before blow drying. If you\u2019re worried about layering products, the lightweight formula of the Kenra Thermal Styling Spray will allow it to be used with other products. As with any heat protectant, it\u2019s important to follow the instructions on the packaging for the best results. When using this spray, you can apply it to hair section by section as you apply your styling tool. When you\u2019re done styling, it\u2019s also advised to spray over your entire head 8 to 10 inches away for a finishing hold. Some buyers did find the formula to be too sticky for their hair, and others felt that it dried out their hair over time.

(Photo: Lacy Atkins \/ The Tennessean)Buy Photo\n\nThe red flags have been there for years.\n\nIn 2016 Illinois police took Waffle House shooting suspect Travis Reinking into protective custody after he was found in a CVS parking lot \"delusional.\"\n\nCLOSE Sheriff Daron Hall gives updates on Travis ReinKing, Waffle House shooting suspect.\n\nReinking believed that Taylor Swift, his family and police were involved in hacking into his phone and stalking him, according to a police report. Family members said he had threatened to kill himself and told police he \"owns and had access to many firearms at his residence.\" His parents told police Reinking had been having similar delusions since 2014.\n\nReinking, who was 27 at the time, was taken to a local hospital for a mental health evaluation. It's unknown what the evaluation found or when he was released.\n\nBetween August 2016 and March 2017, Reinking had moved to the small town of Salida, Colorado. At the crane company where he worked, his bosses and a coworker said he exhibited bizarre behaviors, including an \"obsession\" with Taylor Swift whom he claimed he would marry, but he also complained Swift was stalking and harassing him, and hacking his bank accounts, according to a Salida police report.\n\nReinking claimed he was a \"sovereign citizen\" - a group the FBI defines as anti-government extremists who believe they are separate or \u201csovereign\u201d from the United States. He showed a coworker his guns.\n\nWhen he quit. claiming police were following him, he said he was moving back to Illinois. His former boss in Colorado, Ken Sustrich called his father \"to let him know of concerns he had about Travis' mental health issues.\"\n\nIn June, 2017, Illinois police intervened again. Reinking had threatened an employee of his father's crane company while holding an AR-15 rifle and wearing a pink dress.\n\nLater the same day, he drove to a public pool, took off the pink dress and jumped in, exposing himself and yelling at those present.\n\nMore: Waffle House shooting suspect Travis Reinking's $2 million bond revoked; new charges added\n\nMore: Waffle House hero: Could you rush toward a gunman who just killed people?\n\nIn a report about that incident, police said: \"Travis has some mental problems.\" They searched him for weapons but found none.\n\nPolice contacted Jeff Reinking, Travis' father, who said he had taken three rifles and a hand gun away from his son and locked them up \u2013 but had recently returned them.\n\nMore: Police search Travis Reinking's electronics amid investigation into Waffle House shooting\n\nMore: Sheriff Daron Hall explains how the jail is securing the Waffle House shooting suspect\n\nOne month later, in July 2017, U.S. Secret Service arrested Reinking for being in a \"restricted area\" near the White House. Reinking said he wanted to meet with the president.\n\nThen in early August, 2017, an Illinois police officer encountered Reinking again. Reinking reported that people were tapping into his phone and computer, and that \"unknown people outside his residence barking like dogs.\"\n\nThe officer filed a report, noting \"this is an informational report only. No further action is being taken.\"\n\nLater that month, in connection to the Secret Service arrest, his Illinois firearms authorization was revoked. Local Illinois authorities seized four weapons and placed them with Jeff Reinking. His father later admitted giving the weapons back to his son, but it is unclear when that happened.\n\nEight months later, Reinking made national headlines when he allegedly killed four people and injured several others in a Nashville Waffle House, spurring a 34-hour manhunt until police apprehended him on Monday. Reinking has been charged with four counts of criminal homicide. He remains jailed without bond.\n\nReinking's brushes with the law reveal a pattern of mental instability that raised red flags among local and federal officials \u2013 but they also reveal the limits of law enforcement in removing guns from people whose mental illnesses could pose a risk of danger to the public, experts said.\n\n\"If a police officer is concerned somebody shouldn't have a gun, there's very little an officer can do,\" said Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for stricter gun regulations.\n\nThere is also little that can prevent gun buyers with mental illness from purchasing weapons.\n\nSince 1968, a federal law has barred the possession or acquisition of firearms by anyone who \u201chas been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution.\"\n\nFrom 1998 to 2014, the FBI rejected 16,669 potential gun buyers because a background check found a mental health adjudication, about 1.4 percent of the roughly 1.2 million background checks that resulted in a denial.\n\nThe National Rifle Association has urged policymakers to focus on the nation's mental health system without limiting gun rights. They also have stressed that there are protections in place.\n\n\"The NRA will support any reasonable step to fix America\u2019s broken mental health system without intruding on the constitutional rights of Americans,\" according to a statement posted on the group's website.\n\nMental health professionals support broadening access to mental health care but stress that mental illnesses are not the only factor behind mass shootings.\n\n\"I think we can see in this case a lot of times mental illness is just one of a number of complicated factors that leads someone to do something completely unexplainable,\" said Dr. Jonathan Metzl, director of the Center for Medicine, Health and Society, at Vanderbilt University.\n\nReinking's mental instability, his brushes with the law, access to family guns and differing gun laws in different states that may have allowed him to legally own guns are all contributing factors, Metzl said.\n\nSince the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, mental health has moved to the forefront of the debate over gun control and gun rights.\n\nThe gunman in that case was able to pass a background check despite having been treated at a Virginia hospital as a potential danger to himself or others.\n\nMore recently, the debate emerged again after the Parkland Shooting which claimed the lives of 14 students and three school officials on Feb. 14.\n\nSchool officials and a sheriff's deputy had sought to forcibly commit Nikolas Cruz for a mental evaluation a year before the deadly rampage, but their recommendation was never acted upon. Cruz was able to obtain a gun legally.\n\nIn Tennessee, officials are limited in their authority to remove weapons from individuals \u2013 even those who appear to pose a danger.\n\n\"Until someone commits a crime, there is no authority in the state of Tennessee to take someone's gun,\" said Judge Melissa Blackburn, a General Sessions judge who also presides over Nashville's Mental Health and Veterans Court.\n\nAfter the Parkland shooting, Blackburn and other judges worked with the city's Legal Department to analyze current laws related to gun ownership and mental illness, she said .\n\nWhat they found was the law prohibits mental health professionals at any of the state's inpatient psychiatric facilities from reporting people they have been determined to be mentally defective to local sheriffs or police.\n\nThe law says that those individuals may be reported to the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security or the FBI.\n\nThere is no mechanism that allows judges to take guns from people whom mental health professionals suspect are a danger but have not been convicted of a crime, Blackburn said.\n\n\"We have looked extensively at the law,\" she said. \"We need to get our legislators involved.\"\n\nA handful of states have enacted so-called \"red flag\" laws that typically allow law enforcement or family members to petition a court to temporarily remove guns from an individual who has displayed mental instability or made threats of violence.\n\nIn Tennessee, a bill introduced in January by two Memphis lawmakers would have allowed police officers to petition a judge for a temporary, three-week gun removal order for gun owners who could posed a risk to the public. The bill failed to get out of a legislative committee.\n\nAt a news conference on Tuesday, Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall called Sunday's mass shooting \"evidence that we have too many guns and too many mentally ill people.\n\n\"When you put those two things together in our community, the potential for things like this is going to exist,\" Hall said. \"My hope is we can find a way to reach people who are today suffering from mental illness that we can help, instead of one of these days having another one of these types of cases.\"\n\nReach Anita Wadhwani at awadhwani@tennessean.com, 615-259-8092 or on Twitter @AnitaWadhwani.\n\nWhy the Waffle House shooting stories are free\n\nThe Tennessean is lifting its paywall for coverage of the Waffle House shootings because it is imperative to tell this story to our community and beyond.

The two presidents have gone out of their way to stress their personal chemistry, planting a tree on the White House south lawn, holding a dinner at George Washington\u2019s house at Mount Vernon and hugging, hand-holding and cheek-kissing at the White House on Tuesday, where a traditional arrival ceremony featured nearly 500 members of the US military and a booming 21-gun salute.\n\nBut the intimacy took an awkward turn when Trump took Macron by surprise, ostentatiously brushing what he said was dandruff from the French president\u2019s jacket. \u201cWe have a very special relationship, in fact I\u2019ll get that little piece of dandruff off,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to make him perfect \u2013 he is perfect.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 0:12 I\u2019ll get that little piece of dandruff off, says Trump as he flicks at Macron's jacket - video\n\nSaving the Iran nuclear deal would be a diplomatic coup for Macron, who has taken a political gamble in befriending a US president who is deeply unpopular in Europe.\n\nAt a joint press conference in the East Room of the White House, Macron observed that while Trump saw the Iran nuclear agreement as \u201ca bad deal\u201d, he believes it is \u201cnot sufficient\u201d and proposed a new deal, that would complement the JCPOA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying, we are moving one deal to another,\u201d Macron said, but added that the JCPOA was just one aspect of the problems Iran presented.\n\nIran threatens to withdraw from nuclear weapons treaty Read more\n\nHe said that while the JCPOA restricted Iran\u2019s major nuclear activities until 2025, a new deal would go further, imposing a permanent check on those activities, while also limiting the country\u2019s development of ballistic activities, and its military operations across the region, particularly in Syria.\n\nThe new agreement would include regional powers, like Russia and Iran, who are involved in the Syrian conflict.\n\nThe French president said his White House discussions with Trump \u201cmake it possible to pave the way for a new agreement\u201d. He also insisted: \u201cFrance is not naive when it comes to Iran. We also have a lot of respect for the Iranian people \u2026 but we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.\u201d\n\nIn their remarks, Trump and Macron both hinted heavily that they were close to an understanding.\n\nReferring to his decision on 12 May on whether to continue signing presidential sanctions waivers, Trump suggested he had confided his intentions to his French counterpart. \u201cNobody knows what I\u2019m going to do on the 12th,\u201d he said, turning to Macron and adding: \u201cThough Mr President, you have a pretty good idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can change and we can be flexible. In life, you have to be flexible,\u201d Trump concluded at the end of the joint press conference.\n\nMacron said that US and French officials were working \u201cintensively\u201d together to fashion a new common approach to Iran and the region.\n\n\u201cRegarding Iran, we have a disagreement regarding the JCPOA but I think we are overcoming it by deciding to work towards a deal, an overall deal.\u201d\n\nAt one point, however, Trump issued a blunt warning: \u201cIf Iran threatens us, they are going to pay a price like few countries have ever paid.\u201d\n\nThe US president was also asked about previous hints that he will withdraw US troops from Syria, where he, Macron and Theresa May recently coordinated airstrikes in response to the regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons.\n\n\u201cI would love to bring our incredible warriors back home,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Emmanuel and myself have discussed the fact that we don\u2019t want to give Iran open season to the Mediterranean, especially since we really control it to a large extent \u2026 We are discussing Syria as part of an overall deal.\u201d\n\nThe US president\u2019s upcoming meeting with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, was also in the spotlight. In comments earlier on Tuesday, he raised eyebrows by describing Kim as \u201cvery open\u201d and \u201cvery honourable\u201d.\n\nLater Trump denied that the US had made any concessions in agreeing to the talks. \u201cThe end result is: we\u2019ll see. Maybe good things will happen and maybe we\u2019re all wasting a lot of time.\u201d\n\nUS and North Korea expectations over denuclearization appear to collide Read more\n\nPressed on what denuclearisation meant, he said: \u201cIt means they get rid of their nukes. Very simple. They get rid of their nukes \u2026 It would be very easy to make a simple deal and claim victory. I\u2019m not going to do that. I want them to get rid of their nukes.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Trump admitted that Dr Ronny Jackson, his choice to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, would soon make a decision on whether to withdraw after the emergence of allegations about inappropriate behavior on the job and overprescribing prescription drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s totally his decision,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cI told Admiral Jackson just a little while ago, I said, \u2018What do you need this for?\u2019 This is a vicious group of people that malign and they do and I lived through it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI said, \u2018What do you need it for?\u2019 He\u2019s an admiral, he\u2019s a great leader. And they question him about every little thing.\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s hearing had been set for Wednesday at the Senate veterans affairs committee but was indefinitely postponed amid the allegations.\n\nTrump, Macron and their wives attended a state dinner on Tuesday night.\n\nAlthough French diplomats dismiss media talk of a \u201cbromance\u201d, this is the sixth time the two presidents have met, with the most notable being Trump\u2019s trip to Paris for the Bastille Day parade on 14 July last year. Since Macron came to power, the two presidents have had about 20 phone calls together, according to the Elys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nAt the end of their opening remarks on Tuesday, Trump declared: \u201cI like him a lot.\u201d","9":"Rotation. Motors rotate. Potentiometers and variable capacitors often rotate. It is a common task to have to rotate something remotely or measure the rotation of something. If I asked you today to rotate a volume control remotely, for example, you might offer up an open loop stepper motor or an RC-style servo. If you wanted to measure a rotation, you\u2019d likely use some sort of optical or mechanical encoder. However, there\u2019s a much older way to do those same tasks and one that still sees use in some equipment: a synchro.\n\nThe synchro dates back to the early 1900s when the Panama Canal used them to read and control valves and gates. These devices were very common in World War II equipment, too. In particular, they were often part of the mechanisms that set and read gun azimuth and elevation or \u2014 like the picture to the left \u2014 a position indication of a radar antenna. Even movie cameras used these devices for many years. Today, with more options, you don\u2019t see them as much except in applications where their simplicity and ruggedness is necessary.\n\nHow Do They Work?\n\nA synchro looks like a motor, but it is really a transformer optimized for specific applications. For example, it is common to see a synchro transmitter and a synchro receiver, although usually the devices can work as both. When wired together and excited with the proper AC voltage, turning one synchro shaft will turn the other the same amount. And one transmitter can drive multiple receivers. For example, an airplane cockpit may have an instrument that uses one transmitter and has two receivers, one for the pilot and another for the copilot.\n\nA basic synchro is similar to a motor in that it has a rotor and a stator. However, each of these has a transformer winding. Some devices use single phase and others use three-phase. In addition, devices made for vehicles probably use 400 Hz AC instead of the 50 or 60 Hz common for stationary units. Usually, light-duty units made to drive indicators use single phase but synchros that transmit torque will use three-phase connections.\n\nYou can consider a synchro as a variable-coupling transformer. Rotating the shaft varies the magnitude of the magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary. That means the output voltage varies based on the shaft position. If you wire two synchros together, the circuit acts like a bridge. When the two devices are in the same position, the system is in balance \u2014 that is, putting out equal and opposing voltages. But if one shaft moves, the imbalance causes current to flow through the windings moving the other shaft to equilibrium. This configuration is sometimes known by the old General Electric name Selsyn. Other trade names included Teletorque and Autosyn, but you don\u2019t hear those as often.\n\nVariety and Power\n\nThere are many variations. Some synchros have brushes and others are brushless. Some are made for precision. In high precision applications, you may have a coarse transmitter slaved to a fine transmitter that rotates multiple times for each full rotation of the coarse shaft for reading a more precise value. You can think of this like a clock, where the big hand goes around twelve times for each rotation of the little hand. Usually, the gearing ratio is 36:1 or 72:1 so that each rotation of the fine shaft corresponds to five or ten degrees of the coarse transmitter.\n\nMaking a little handle turn a giant gun mount was problematic. At first, the receiver motor just told a human what to do using an indicator and then the human operated the gun. However, the development of the amplidyne made it possible to amplify the synchro outputs to directly drive larger loads.\n\nThe Amplidyne\n\nThe amplidyne has a superficial resemblance to a dynamotor \u2014 that is, a generator turned by a motor. However, in a dynamotor, you turn the generator to make a high voltage. In an amplidyne, the motor still turns the generator, but an input voltage is put on the generator\u2019s field winding. The more current you apply, the higher the output voltage. This creates a very low-frequency amplifier that takes a current input and produces a voltage output.\n\nAmplidynes found use in other applications, too. Elevators, locomotives, and even nuclear submarines. Of course, today, we have much better options for doing high power amplification, but there could be a few still hiding in some old building\u2019s elevator, somewhere.\n\nMore Info\n\nBecause these were used extensively in the Navy, one of the best sources of information is an old Navy pamphlet (if you consider 166 pages a pamphlet; if it disappears, search for OP 1303). If you want something more modern, Moog (the aerospace company, not the synthesizer company, although the companies were founded by cousins) has an application guide and a handbook you might find interesting.\n\nYou won\u2019t find too many of these interesting devices in use today, although there are companies that make modern encoders that specifically target traditional synchro applications. Of course, tubes made a comeback. Maybe that pile of World War II surplus synchros in the secret Hackaday bunker will be worth something one day.\n\nSpeaking of World War II, check out the 1944 instructional video below about airplanes that could move guns electrically using all these components.\n\nPhoto Credits:\n\nSynchro by MGeek CC BY-SA-3.0","10":"(LAS VEGAS) \u2014 A month after speaking at the March for Our Lives in his hometown of Austin, Texas, Matthew McConaughey says he supports some gun control but fears the youth-led movement could be \u201chijacked\u201d by those hoping to eliminate all guns in the United States.\n\nMcConaughey spoke about his support for the marchers on Monday in Las Vegas, where he was promoting his upcoming film, White Boy Rick, at the CinemaCon theater-owners convention.\n\nHe called gun violence \u201can epidemic in our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of friends who are gun owners. I\u2019ve got a lot of friends who are NRA (National Rifle Association). I grew up hunting. We had responsible gun ownership, but I was taught the right way to respect that tool,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, their petition that they were speaking about is a very good one. And I also fear that their campaign \u2014 they have to watch that they don\u2019t get hijacked. Meaning, a lot of the crowd was for no guns at all. That was not the march for life. March for Our Lives was for rightful, just, responsible gun ownership \u2014 but against assault rifles, against unlimited magazines and for following up on the regulations.\u201d\n\nThe 48-year-old Oscar winner said he hoped to find room for agreement between anti-gun activists and the NRA.\n\n\u201cThe two sides (have) got to talk. Because we both agree that there\u2019s an epidemic. We both agree something has got to change. So I was for what they were marching for, and I wanted to speak to my hometown on the capital of my state Texas\u2019 steps. And also talk to the many men and women who I grew up with, I know that had the guns, that owned the guns, and say hey, do we really, where can we reach across the aisle here?

Hogg added that he wants to go to American cities dealing with gun violence, like Chicago, to help people \u201craise their voice.\u201d\n\nCameron Kasky, another Parkland survivor, said Tuesday that he hopes former President Barack Obama, who wrote about them in the 2018 TIME 100, \u201cgoes out and votes in November.\u201d\n\nHogg and Kasky were named to the 2018 TIME 100, along with their classmates Emma Gonz\u00e1lez, Alex Wind and Jaclyn Corin.\n\nThe five students from Parkland, Fla. started the #NeverAgain movement to curb gun violence after 17 of their peers and faculty members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were murdered on Feb. 14.\n\nThe Parkland students\u2019 impassioned responses to the mass shooting spurred a national debate on gun violence and reinvigorated calls for new gun control laws. On March 24, they commanded national attention in Washington, D.C., where hundreds of thousands of people converged for the March For Our Lives demonstration.\n\n\u201cBy bearing witness to carnage, by asking tough questions and demanding real answers, the Parkland students are shaking us out of our complacency,\u201d Obama wrote about the young Parkland activists as part of the 2018 TIME 100.","13":"The suspect in the deadly van attack in Toronto posted a chilling Facebook message just minutes before plowing into a crowded city sidewalk, authorities said Tuesday, raising the possibility that he may have nursed grudges against women \u2014 a possible echo of a 1989 massacre of 14 women that remains one of Canada\u2019s most traumatic acts of violence.\n\nThe 25-year-old suspect, Alek Minassian, was charged Tuesday with first degree murder in the deaths of 10 pedestrians he mowed down in the rented van he sent careening along the busy walkway. Fourteen others were injured.\n\nToronto Police Services Det. Sgt. Graham Gibson told a news conference that those killed and injured were \u201cpredominantly\u201d women, though he declined to discuss a possible motive.\n\n\u201cAll the lanes are open with this investigation,\u201d said Police Chief Mark Saunders.\n\nAuthorities have not yet released a list of victims. Those known to have been killed include a 30-year-old woman from Toronto, Anne Marie D\u2019Amico, who was active in volunteer work, as well as a female student at Seneca College, which Minassian also attended. A Jordanian citizen and two South Koreans were also among those killed.\n\nThe gender issue arose because of what police called a \u201ccryptic\u201d Facebook message posted by Minassian just before the incident that suggested he was part of an online community angry over their inability to form relationships with women.\n\nThe now-deleted post saluted Elliot Rodger, a community college student who killed six people and wounded 13 in shooting and stabbing attacks near the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2014.\n\nCalling Rodger \u201cthe Supreme Gentleman,\u201d the Facebook post declared: \u201cThe Incel Rebellion has already begun! We will overthrow all the Chads and Stacys!\u201d\n\nRodger had used the term \u201cincel\u201d \u2014 for involuntarily celibate \u2014 in online posts raging at women for rejecting him romantically. Like-minded people in internet forums sometimes use \u201cChad\u201d and \u201cStacy\u201d as dismissive slang for men and women with more robust sex lives.\n\nThe anti-women sentiment recalled the 1989 massacre at the Ecole Polytechnique, an engineering college in Montreal, when 25-year-old Marc Lepine entered a classroom, separated the men from the women, told the men to leave and opened fire, killing 14 women before killing himself. In a suicide note, he blamed feminists for ruining his life.\n\nSince then, there have been sporadic mass shootings in Canada, but none with a higher death toll \u2014 reinforcing the view among many Canadians that their country is less violent than the United States.\n\n\u201cCanadians don\u2019t know who they are, but they know who they are not \u2014 they\u2019re not Americans,\u201d said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. \u201cThey perceive that Canada, relative to the U.S., is a peaceable kingdom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t to say everything\u2019s hunky dory in Canada,\u201d Wiseman added. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have this constant string of mass shootings that keep happening, and then nothing changes.\u201d\n\nWendy Cukier, a professor of justice studies at Toronto\u2019s Ryerson University and president of Canada\u2019s Coalition for Gun Control, said Canada may avoid some types of violence because its social programs are stronger than those in many U.S. states and it has less income inequality. But the main difference, she contends, is tighter gun regulations in Canada.\n\n\u201cIf you take guns out of the mix, Canada and the U.S. are identical,\u201d she said, citing statistics indicating the two countries have similar rates of non-firearm homicides.\n\nAlthough police say Monday\u2019s rampage does not appear linked to international terrorism, the use of a vehicle to kill mirrored tactics used by terrorists in France, Germany, Spain, New York City and elsewhere.\n\nSince 2014, there have been at least two terror-related cases in Canada of vehicles being used as weapons \u2014 they caused several injuries and one death. But overall, Canada has been spared high-casualty terror attacks; its most striking incidents of violence over the past 50 years have varied widely in nature.\n\nIn 2014 a Muslim-Canadian gunman killed a member of the honor guard at Ottawa\u2019s national war memorial, then stormed Parliament, where he was shot dead by a sergeant-at arms. Last year, a French-Canadian man shot dead six Muslim men during evening prayers at a mosque in Quebec City. Back in 1972, 37 people died in a Montreal cafe deliberately set on fire by three men who had been refused entry.\n\nIn Toronto, Canadian rapper Maestro Fresh Wes returned Tuesday to the scene of the rampage, pausing by a newly erected memorial. Wes, who lives nearby, was strolling down Yonge Street, heading to his barber to get a haircut when he saw a body bag on the ground.\n\n\u201cYesterday was the most beautiful day of the year and then look what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cToronto is a safe city but things could happen anywhere. When these things happen, you have to reflect.\u201d\n\nAlso revisiting the site was Saman Tabasinejad, a New Democrat Party politician who was canvassing in the area when the attack occurred.\n\n\u201cI saw shattered glass everywhere, a fire hydrant knocked over and then five body bags,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were holding others and I saw solidarity all over, people trying to help others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen something like this happens, you think people are going to run away from the tragedy but people didn\u2019t, they ran towards it to try to help others,\u201d she added. \u201cIt shows that something like this could happen at the hands of one person, but so many more stand against it and show their humanity.\u201d","14":"A man has been shocked repeatedly with a Taser gun and arrested on board a plane after he allegedly groped another passenger, Miami police said.\n\nAccording to American Airlines, there was a \u201cdisagreement\u201d between Jacob Garcia, 28, and others on Flight 2446 as the aircraft was waiting to depart Miami International Airport for Chicago.\n\nThe dispute started after Mr Garcia allegedly touched a woman without her permission, according to an arrest report.\n\nHe was moved to another seat, but started to shout abuse at the female passenger and her partner, the report said. Flight attendants asked Mr Garcia to get off the plane but he refused, the file claimed.\n\nFootage of the incident showed three officers surrounding the 28-year-old, who is reportedly from Chicago.\n\n\u201cWhat is the reason why you\u2019re removing me from this plane?\u201d he asks.\n\nA male voice says: \u201cWell you just assaulted a lady for one.\u201d\n\nMr Garcia then says: \u201cNo, you guys are just trying to get on social media.\u201d\n\nThe unknown male then says: \u201cYou\u2019re a racist, for two.\u201d\n\nThe struggle continues, with one officer urging Mr Garcia not to \u201cfight\u201d.\n\nWhen the man asks again why he is being removed from the flight, an officer takes out a Taser and fires it at him.\n\nIn between shocks the man asks why he is being removed from the aircraft.\n\nThe police report says the Miami-Dade officer used his Taser 10 times because he was \u201cunable to holster his electronic control weapon\u201d due to \u201cMr Garcia\u2019s actions and the close quarters of the engagement\u201d.\n\nEventually, Mr Garcia walked off the plane under police escort, but he continued to resist and twice tried to grab a police officer\u2019s gun, according to the report.\n\nHe was taken to Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Centre, where he was charged with battery, depriving an officer of a firearm, criminal mischief and disorderly conduct, officials said.\n\nAmerican Airlines said in its statement it followed its normal procedures after the \u201cdisagreement\u201d between passengers broke out, adding that the flight departed with the remaining passengers about an hour after the scheduled time.","15":"The suspect in the fatal van attack in Toronto wrote a Facebook post highlighting his violent misogynist tendencies prior to running down pedestrians on a walkway on Monday.\n\nAlek Minassian, 25, was charged with first degree murder in the deaths of 10 pedestrians after he plowed through a walkway. Most of his victims were women. While authorities have not yet announced a motive, police said Minassian posted a \u201ccryptic\u201d message on Facebook indicating he was a part of the \u201cincel\u201d community, or an online group of \u201cinvoluntary celibate\u201d men who blame women for rejecting them.\n\nIn his post, Minassian praised Elliot Rodger, the man who killed six students and wounded 14 in a 2014 attack near the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\n\u201cThe Incel Rebellion has already begun,\u201d Minassian wrote in a since-deleted Facebook post. \u201cWe will overthrow all the Chads and Stacys! All hail Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger!\u201d\n\nIt is not immediately clear if Minassian posted on internet incel forums or what his motive for the attack was. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks the community of \u201cinvoluntary celibates\u201d as part of its watch on male supremacists, says the group looks at punishing women who reject them sexually or romantically as an act of heroism.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re being supposed gentlemen, and feel they should be rewarded for it,\u201d says Eric Mankowski, a psychology professor at Portland State University. \u201cWhen they perceive they are not being rewarded, they resort to a violent response to gain back what they think they are entitled to.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about the term \u201cincel\u201d and the community it attracts.\n\nWhat are incels?\n\n\u201cIncels\u201d or \u201cinvoluntary celibates\u201d are misogynistic men who, feeling overlooked, invisible and disrespected, blame women for their lack of success in the bedroom, often resorting to violent and dehumanizing language, according to Mankowski. In their world, \u201cChads\u201d are men who find success with women, while \u201cStacys\u201d are the women who reject incels.\n\nAlmost any man raised in contemporary society, where traditional definitions of masculinity still rule, is susceptible to being drawn into online incel communities, Mankowski says.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of a particular rare bad apple, but it\u2019s really a question of: Why are we socializing boys and men to have ways of being and beliefs that are associated with acts of mass violence?\u201d\n\nThe \u201cincel rebellion\u201d mentioned by Minassian refers to discussions among incels about an uprising led by \u201cbeta\u201d males to take over feminism\u2019s oppressive control, the New York Times reports.\n\nHow has misogyny driven other instances of mass violence?\n\nThe attack by Minassian and his salute to Elliot Rodger immediately recalls the Isla Vista killings, in which the 22-year-old Rodger killed six people \u2014 three men in his apartment and three women outside a sorority house \u2014 and injured 14 others in May 2014. Rodger carried out his attack through stabbing, shooting and running people down in a vehicle. He was then found dead in his car with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nBefore carrying out the attack, Rodger uploaded a video to YouTube raging against women from a local sorority who he felt had rejected him, thus leaving him a virgin.\n\n\u201cTomorrow is the day of retribution for the last eight years of my life, ever since I\u2019ve hit puberty, I\u2019ve been forced to endure and existence of loneliness, rejection, and unfulfilled desires \u2026 I don\u2019t know why you girls are not attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it,\u201d Rodger said in the video, which YouTube later took down.\n\nRodger, who referred to himself as an incel, detailed the plans for his attack in a lengthy, rambling manifesto, which, along with numerous Facebook posts, a blog and other videos, revealed his hatred for women and anger at seeing other couples interact with each other.\n\nThe deadly van attack on Monday also recalls a misogyny-fueled massacre in 1989, when the 25-year-old Marc Lepine killed 14 women in a classroom at the Ecole Polytechnique engineering college in Montreal after asking all the men in the room to leave. Lepine shot the women before killing himself, saying in a suicide note that feminists had ruined his life.\n\nOther attacks that resulted in mass casualties have also been linked to violence against women. Most mass shootings between 2009 and 2016 had to do with domestic and family cases, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-violence prevention group. In 54% of incidents where four or more people were killed with a gun, an intimate partner or family member was a victim. And of 46 public mass shootings since 2009, 33% of the shooters had a history of violent behavior toward women, according to a TIME analysis of Everytown data.\n\nMankowski says the general conversation about masculinity and violence needs to shift. When white men are found to be behind mass attacks, the reigning narrative focuses on their mental health problems, substance abuse issues or their romantic entanglements, rather than on the messaging boys and men receive about how to respond to their issues. Women, Mankowski notes, also suffer from mental health problems and romantic rejection and abuse substances, but it\u2019s almost \u201cunheard of that they would commit mass violence,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe long-term strategy is examining the implied and taught messages on how to be men \u2014 they comply with these messages about manhood because there\u2019s privilege and status and benefits that you garner if you perform the role as it\u2019s being taught,\u201d he says. \u201cIncel is saying, \u2018I\u2019m doing the role and not getting the benefits, and I\u2019m particularly likely to respond with violence.\u2019\u201d\n\nHow have self-described incels reacted to the Toronto van attack?\n\nIncels gather online in spaces like 4chan, an anonymous message board, after Reddit banned the community. While administrators of websites like incel.me have condemned the attack, many online users have heralded Minassian and condoned violence against women. Incels also valorize Rodgers and have also commended Nikolas Cruz, the suspect charged in the killing of 17 people in a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February.\n\n\u201cThe constant torture that society puts us through every single day brews rightful hatred in our minds,\u201d reads one message posted on an Incel group on Wednesday. \u201cThat is what happens when a man is put through so much bullying, ostracization, and persecution throughout his life.\u201d","16":"It was early Sunday morning. Very early--around 3:20 a.m. Tragedy would soon strike as a man armed with an AR-15 approached a busy Waffle House restaurant in Nashville, Tennessee, and opened fire. He killed four people.\n\nHe could have killed many more.\n\nThat is, if it wasn't for James Shaw Jr.\n\nShaw and his friend, Brennan McMurry, were looking for a bite to eat after a night out. They ended up at Waffle House, completely unaware of how their lives were about to change forever.\n\nThe New York Times describes the scene:\n\nBullets shattered the restaurant's windows. A man collapsed onto the floor. Servers ran. A young man whom Mr. Shaw had seen minutes earlier, silhouetted in a pickup truck, was gripping an AR-15 rifle. He was squeezing the trigger, and squeezing it again as he moved toward the building. Then the firing paused. Mr. Shaw could see the man reloading his weapon just after entering the restaurant. He sensed a moment when he could fight back.\n\n\"I acted in a blink of a second,\" Shaw told the Times. \"When he reloaded his clip, that felt like 30 minutes. I looked at him, and he wasn't looking at me. He just had the barrel down. It was like, 'Do it now. Go now.' I just took off.\"\n\nShaw says when the shooting started, he dived towards the bathroom. After seeing the gunman pause and point the barrel of his rifle down to the ground, he then rushed the man, hitting him with the door. Shaw then grabbed the barrel of the gun (which resulted in second-degree burns to his hand, since the barrel was still hot). After an intense scuffle, Shaw managed to gain control of the rifle, which he then threw over a countertop.\n\n\"I think anybody could've did what I did if they're just pushed in that kind of cage, and you have to either react or you're going to, you know, fold,\" Shaw went on to say. \"I was completely doing it just to save myself. Now, me doing that, I did save other people. But I don't want people to think that I was the Terminator or Superman or anybody like that. It was just, I figured if I was going to die, he was going to have to work for it.\"\n\n\"I'm not a hero. I'm just a regular person,\" Shaw said afterward.\n\nAs I've watched numerous interviews with Shaw in the aftermath of that traumatic experience, I am impressed at his ability to remain humble, downplay his actions, and deflect attention away from himself.\n\nWhat I see is a remarkable example of real-world emotional intelligence.\n\nWhat's EQ got to do with it?\n\nEmotional intelligence is the ability to identify emotions (in both yourself and others), to recognize the powerful effects of those emotions, and to use that information to inform and guide behavior. It begins with understanding how emotions work, but it goes much further. Specifically, how do you put that knowledge into practice?\n\nOr, put more simply, how do you make emotions work for you, instead of against you?\n\nLike many others, I've been fascinated by Shaw's ability to react in those pivotal, life-altering seconds that fateful morning in Waffle House.\n\nBasically, Shaw had three options: He could fight for his life, try to flee, or simply freeze. And although he believes anyone would have made the same decision as he did, that's not entirely true. Many would be--and have been--paralyzed by fear in similar circumstances.\n\nA reporter asked Shaw about this in an interview, and his answer gives us an inside look into his thought process.\n\nReporter: \"So many people would have hid in the bathroom and would have not come out until this was over. What made you go after him?\" Shaw: \"That mindset is kind of like 'shooting fish in a barrel' to me, because there was a concrete wall there. In the bathroom, it's only one way in and one way out. And I was like, he's going to have to work for this kill--for me, personally. So, I just got a head full of steam, and I ran through the door. And it worked out like I wanted it to.\" Reporter: \"Were you scared?\" Shaw: \"Yes! [Laughing.] Yes.\"\n\nThe key here is that Shaw found a way to think through the situation. Instead of allowing his fear to paralyze him, he used it as a catalyst to move him to action.\n\nIn EQ terms, this is what we call self-management, the ability to manage emotions in a way that allows you to accomplish a task, reach a goal, or provide a benefit.\n\nSince emotions involve your natural, instinctive feelings and are influenced by your unique brain chemistry, you can't always control how you feel. But you can control the way you act (or refrain from acting) upon those feelings. Practicing self-control can help you react in a productive way, especially in an emotionally charged situation.\n\nShaw's ability to effectively manage his emotions is one reason he's here to tell us the story. And we can only guess how many lives he saved in the process.\n\nShaw continued to demonstrate emotional intelligence in various ways in the minutes, hours, and days that followed. He encouraged others not to stare at the bodies of the victims, warning that doing so would haunt them. He started a GoFundMe page to help the families of the victims from the shooting. (As of time of writing, the page has raised more than $75,000--far surpassing the initial goal of $15,000.)\n\nAnd Shaw continues to deflect any praise thrown his way--from hospital workers, police, the CEO of Waffle House, Nashville's mayor...and from those would-be victims and their families.\n\nOf course, we shouldn't be surprised.\n\nAfter all, that's what true heroes do.","17":"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Thinkstock.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy mother married and had me while she was in high school. She is the bravest woman I know, and she raised my brother and me by herself, put herself through college, and has finally married the love of her life after divorcing my alcoholic father and waste-of-space stepfather. Recently, she discovered she was pregnant again at 41. I am 23 and three months pregnant with my first child. Everyone else in my family, even my younger brother, is happy about our concurrent pregnancies, openly celebrating and making jokes. I feel so weird about this. I get flashes of jealousy and resentment toward my mother and her pregnancy. She obviously is very focused on her own health and family right now, but I feel abandoned. It\u2019s as if this baby has cheated me out of having a mom, or my mother has betrayed me by getting pregnant. I hate myself for feeling this way. It is irrational and petty and hateful, and I can\u2019t even tell anyone about it! I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know if it is hormones, or if I have always been an awful person. My husband has commented on the mood swings I have after I talk to my mother, but I lie and just say I am tired. I feel trapped. How do I stop this? How do I get these feelings under control and out of my head? My mother and I are both pregnant, married to lovely men, in good health, and happily employed. I have nothing to be upset over, but I am, and I hate it.\n\n\u2014Pregnant and Resentful\n\nThere\u2019s a significant difference between \u201cI have nothing to be upset over\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m feeling something negative that I don\u2019t have to do anything about.\u201d You\u2019re very aware that just because you\u2019re upset it doesn\u2019t mean your mother has done anything wrong, and you\u2019re capable of being happy for her hard-won joy. What you\u2019re experiencing is a pretty typical oldest-child response to finding out you\u2019re about to get a younger sibling: surprise, resentment, fear that you\u2019re going to be loved less or pushed aside, anxious, insecure. The fact that you\u2019re experiencing this unexpectedly, in your 20s, and on the verge of becoming a mother yourself makes this additionally intense. You\u2019re not taking this out on your mother or expecting the world to change to suit your needs. You\u2019re not an awful person. Don\u2019t censor yourself when your husband asks you what\u2019s wrong. Instead, ask him to hear you out and help you talk through your feelings. Consider seeing a therapist or talking about this with a trusted friend for the next few months as you deal with the day-to-day realities of going through pregnancy at the same time as your mother.\n\nDear Prudence Uncensored\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so normal to want to be parented a little yourself during such a new and difficult time.\u201d\n\nDaniel Mallory Ortberg and Nicole Cliffe discuss this letter in this week\u2019s Dear Prudence Uncensored\u2014only for Slate Plus members.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI live in a three-bedroom house with a couple, who use the master bedroom, and \u201cHannah.\u201d Hannah and I have our own rooms but share a Jack-and-Jill bathroom. We\u2019ve always gotten along. I routinely take an hourlong bath every day at 6 p.m. I work early and then go to the gym; this has always been my schedule. Recently Hannah hosted her sisters and parents for a visit. Hannah was out and didn\u2019t tell her family about my schedule. I was in the bath when one of her sisters started pounding on the door, saying they needed to get ready to go out. I yelled that I was in the bath. Twenty minutes later, I heard a second pounding on the door. The other sister wanted to use the bathroom. Again, I told her I was in the bath. Both sisters and Hannah\u2019s mother then had a loud discussion of how \u201chorribly rude\u201d I was. I guess they didn\u2019t realize I could hear them through the door. Apparently it\u2019s a huge breach of manners to take a bath when you have guests.\n\nThe icing on the cake: Hannah\u2019s mother said I was obviously raised in a barn and my mother should be ashamed of me. I was so embarrassed I didn\u2019t say anything. I stayed in my room all weekend and pled illness to get out of the dinner my other roommates were hosting. I can\u2019t get that conversation out of my head, but I don\u2019t see what good it will do to tell Hannah. What should I do?\n\n\u2014Bath Blues\n\nThe breach of manners wasn\u2019t taking a bath, the breach of manners was continuing with your hourlong bath despite knowing that there were guests in the house who wanted to get ready on a tight schedule. After hearing the first knock, you should have said \u201cI\u2019m taking a bath, but I\u2019ll be out as soon as I can,\u201d cut your bath short, and made the room available. In the future, if guests come to visit\u2014whether Hannah\u2019s family or anyone else\u2014wrap up your baths after 20 minutes and save the long, luxurious soaks for nights when you know no one else needs the bathroom. I\u2019m sorry you had to hear Hannah\u2019s family members venting their frustration, but I think this is worth letting go. If Hannah\u2019s family visits again, you can say something polite and to-the-point like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I hogged the bathroom last time; if I\u2019m ever using it when you need to get ready, just let me know, and I\u2019ll be sure to wrap up as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI\u2019m a happily married man with a young child. Last autumn, an old female friend from college emailed me to reconnect (she\u2019s not on social media). We never dated or flirted, and most of our interactions were tied to our coursework. We then texted for a bit and made vague plans for her to see my band when we were on tour in her part of the country. I told my wife about the correspondence in passing at the time. My band\u2019s tour never materialized, so we didn\u2019t end up seeing each other.\n\nThis old friend emailed me again for my address, and I obliged, thinking she got engaged or something. My wife always gets the mail, but the friend\u2019s postcard, addressed to me and family and written in flowery glitter pen, was delivered to our downstairs neighbor by mistake, and I picked it up off the landing while my wife was away for the weekend. On the card, my old friend wrote that she can\u2019t wait to reach out to visit when she\u2019s in the Midwest this summer. The glitter pen looks weird. Can I throw it away and pretend like I never got it? It\u2019s in a hoodie pocket now in the back of my closet, and I\u2019m afraid not initially showing it to my wife makes it look like I\u2019m guilty.\n\n\u2014Glitter Postcard\n\nI think you are more stressed out about this than you need to be. You don\u2019t say anything felt off about the contents of the postcard\u2014a postcard addressed to your entire family saying she\u2019s looking forward to getting together when she\u2019s in town is hardly clandestine or suggestive. And glitter pen is not some universally agreed-upon code for \u201cLet\u2019s commit adultery!\u201d It\u2019s not inherently flirtatious, or the equivalent of sealing the back of the envelope with a red lipstick kiss. I think you\u2019re jumping the gun here. If you\u2019re not interested in reviving what was only ever an incidental friendship, you\u2019re under no obligation to stay in touch with this woman, but neither are you obligated to tell your wife anything, because there\u2019s not really anything to tell.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nA friend of a friend contacted me about six months ago asking for money. He was in a tough place and was reaching out to anyone who had previously donated to a GoFundMe he had set up a few months earlier. I gave a little and didn\u2019t think much of it. Since then, he\u2019s continually messaged me for money, and the requests have started coming more often. I get that it\u2019s hard out there, and he\u2019s really on the ropes, but I can\u2019t afford to give as much as he\u2019s asking. Should I stop giving money? How do I set up boundaries with a stranger?\n\n\u2014How Do I Stop Giving Money?\n\nYou should definitely stop giving money you can\u2019t afford to give away! You can set up boundaries with him by telling him you\u2019re no longer available to make donations. That\u2019s all you have to do! Either he\u2019ll stop asking you, in which case your work is done, or he\u2019ll continue sending requests, which you can either ignore or block, as you prefer. Just because you\u2019ve done something in the past doesn\u2019t mean you are obligated to continue doing it indefinitely.\n\nHow to Get Advice From Prudie:\n\n\u2022 Send questions for publication to prudence@slate.com.\n\n(Questions may be edited.)\n\n\u2022 Join the live chat every Monday at noon.

I loved it but left when my dream job opened up. I used to visit there frequently to eat. I told an old co-worker, Mike, that I was selling my house, and he put in an offer, which I accepted. It seemed perfect, but things soured quickly. Mike called and texted me constantly about issues with the sale rather than talking to my realtor. Negotiations got heated and personal, and I told Mike not to contact me again. He turned icy. While I\u2019m glad I stuck up for myself, I feel anxious about ever going back to the restaurant. It\u2019s a small place with a small staff, so the odds of seeing Mike are high. I wish I was the kind of person who could flounce in and relish watching him serve me after being a jerk, but I\u2019m leaning more toward investing in a good disguise. What else can I do that doesn\u2019t involve spirit gum prosthetics?\n\n\u2014Can\u2019t Go Home Again\n\nI don\u2019t think you should wish to be the kind of person who could revel in watching someone you don\u2019t like wait tables! Working as a waiter is not some sort of just punishment for having been rude, pushy, and invasive. If you want to give the restaurant a wide berth for a little while and wait for the emotional dust to settle, go for it; try to make plans with friends when you finally do revisit so your first trip isn\u2019t by yourself. Don\u2019t go out of your way to speak to Mike, and in the meantime, try exploring other restaurants (with less fraught associations) in your city.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nLast year I came out as trans. My wife, our child, and our friends have inundated me with love and support. Our families, not so much. We both come from conservative religious backgrounds. Immediately after I came out, they stopped returning our calls and texts. Some deleted us from their social media. We were not invited over for the holidays, and none of them showed up to our 6-year-old son\u2019s birthday party. My son keeps asking for them, and we don\u2019t know what to tell him about why Nana and Papa no longer visit weekly, or why everyone was absent for his birthday and Christmas.\n\nWe assumed our parents would have trouble coping but never thought they would abandon their grandchild. We are aware that we could always go to their homes to try to start a dialogue, but we both agree there\u2019s no use in trying to force someone to have a relationship with us. We\u2019d been putting off our son\u2019s questions with \u201cThey\u2019re just very busy,\u201d in the hopes that they\u2019d come around, but it\u2019s been almost a year. What should we tell him? Would the truth impede my son\u2019s ability to reconnect with his family in the future? Should we even want that? While most of my transition has gone better than expected, this one thing has been filling me with guilt. I flip-flop between sadness for my son not having a large family like I did and being relieved that he won\u2019t have to experience their brand of conditional love.\n\n\u2014My Family Abandoned My Son Because I Came Out as Trans\n\nI\u2019m so sorry that your families have turned their backs on you and your wife and son, and that you\u2019re having to explain this to a 6-year-old boy who misses his grandparents. I think you\u2019re right to want to tell him the truth, because at this point it must be clear to him that they\u2019re not \u201cjust busy.\u201d Worse, he might start to think that at any moment someone he loves could disappear suddenly and irrevocably because that\u2019s how being busy works\u2014so trying to replace uncertainty and doubt with clarity, even if it\u2019s painful, is ultimately your best choice. He\u2019s a little young to go into much detail, but you can stress the salient facts: that your family has decided they don\u2019t want to see you anymore after your transition, that some people are prejudiced against trans people, that you and your wife love your son and will always be here for him. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way you can effectively keep the truth from your son in the long run, and whether he\u2019s ever able to reconnect with them is up in the air (and in many ways outside of your control). If that\u2019s ever possible, it won\u2019t be because he\u2019s been shielded from the truth about the nature of your parents\u2019 decision to shun you.\n\nClassic Prudie\n\n\u201cAfter a lot of soul-searching, I\u2019ve decided to divorce my wife of five years. All we did was fight, and we had little in the way of sexual intimacy. The problem is that my soon-to-be ex-wife just had a baby a few weeks ago. It\u2019s four weeks after the birth, and things are worse. We fight constantly and we haven\u2019t had sex for almost four months, so last week I finally got the courage to break ties and move into an apartment.\u201d","18":"Republican candidate for U.S. Senate Don Blankenship speaks at a town hall meeting at West Virginia University on March 1 in Morgantown, West Virginia. Spencer Platt\/Getty Images\n\nWHEELING, West Virginia\u2014At a primary debate here on Monday night, six Republicans vying to represent West Virginia in the U.S. Senate were asked if there is any issue where they disagree with President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Jack Newbrough, a trucker whose immediate reply was quickly matched by the next four candidates.\n\nRep. Evan Jenkins, the GOP establishment\u2019s preferred candidate, mentioned, for neither the first nor the last time in the evening, that he had been a \u201cproud supporter\u201d of Trump from the beginning and would never join the chorus of those \u201cpicking on him.\u201d Not to be outdone, the state\u2019s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, who has the backing of many conservative groups, described the pride he felt as an Electoral College member in 2016 when he cast his ballot for the president and made sure to mention a personal meeting with the president\u2014no big deal\u2014noting that \u201cthis guy\u2019s a prankster.\u201d\n\nOnly the sixth and final candidate\u2014the quiet one with no tie, whose mere presence in the race strikes fear into the heart of Mitch McConnell\u2014was left to disagree.\n\n\u201cActually, I disagree with the president on a lot of things,\u201d said Don Blankenship, the convicted coal baron, in a soft, drawling voice, \u201cbut I love him to death\u2014to think that we were very lucky to dodge the bullet of Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nNow, Republicans are trying to dodge the bullet of Don Blankenship. Blankenship was in prison this time last year, nearing the end of a one-year sentence for misdemeanor conspiracy to violate mining safety standards. As CEO of Massey Energy, he presided over the 2010 Upper Big Branch explosion in which 29 coal miners lost their lives. He has argued that his prosecution was political, coming at the hands of both President Barack Obama\u2019s federal government and then-Gov. Joe Manchin\u2019s state government. Blankenship\u2019s campaign is an opportunity for revenge against Manchin, who now holds the Senate seat, and his supposed martyrdom at the hands of Obama has helped make Blankenship a top contender. After blanketing the airwaves with ads\u2014paid for out of his own pocket\u2014polling in March showed him right in the thick of it alongside Morrisey and Jenkins.\n\nThe fear within the GOP establishment is that they could squander a prime pickup opportunity in a blood-red state\u2014where Trump won with 68 percent of the vote\u2014 on a candidate fresh out of jail for mining safety violations that led to the deaths of 29 people. So, they\u2019ve sent in the cavalry. An independent-expenditures group called Mountain Families PAC\u2014organized by the usual assortment of Washington and Northern Virginia GOP operatives\u2014has been running ads against Blankenship. The attacks might be working, too: A poll released during Monday night\u2019s debate showed Blankenship\u2019s position faltering.\n\nWith two weeks to go until the May 8 primary, Democrats have countered by bolstering Blankenship. A Democratic-aligned group, Duty and Country PAC, has begun spending hundreds of thousands of dollars aimed at bringing down Morrisey and Jenkins\u2014though they\u2019ve mostly focused on Jenkins. The Federal Election Commission\u2013listed treasurer for the group is Booth Goodwin, who oversaw the prosecution of Blankenship during his tenure as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia. In other words, the man who put Blankenship behind bars is now aiding his primary campaign. In a strategy that has never backfired spectacularly for the party, Democrats hope to usher Blankenship through the primary so that Manchin can waltz through the general election.\n\nIf the attacks are bothering Blankenship, he didn\u2019t show it on Monday night. As his competitors fake-smiled at each other, Blankenship barely shot anyone a glance. When it wasn\u2019t his turn to speak, Blankenship would put on his reading glasses and take notes. He seemed oblivious, at times, that others were even with him, or that he wasn\u2019t supposed to touch Donald Trump with even the mildest of critiques.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with his personal behavior at times,\u201d he said. \u201cI sometimes worry that we still have this tendency to police the world, which is very expensive for American taxpayers. I agree with Comey that his tie\u2019s a little too long. I think he tweets too much.\u201d\n\nJenkins, for his part, is trying to use the Democratic attacks as a rallying cry, arguing that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are trying to destroy him because they know he has the best chance to beat Manchin. It\u2019s always a boring, establishment move to argue that primary voters should choose you because you\u2019re the most electable, so Jenkins is trying to reframe the same basic idea into a tale of how national Democrats fear his nomination. (Jenkins also reiterated several times what he saw as the stakes of the election, too, warning that Democrats would pursue impeachment should they retake control of Congress.)\n\nJenkins\u2019 pitch is complicated by the presence of Morrisey, the state attorney general, who checks all the boxes for hard-right conservative voters, like endorsements from pro-life groups and \u201call the gun groups,\u201d as well as a long-record of lawsuits filed against the Obama administration. He described how he\u2019s \u201cworking with the president\u201d to bring an end to \u201cthese awful sanctuary cities.\u201d During a discussion on guns, which immediately became a competition about who loves guns the most\u2014\u201cI\u2019m carrying,\u201d Newbrough said\u2014Morrisey described how he had just partnered with the NRA at a local middle school to do a \u201cphysical assessment\u201d of how to prevent mass shootings.\n\nBut rank-and-file Republicans have shown a willingness to reject anyone affiliated not just with the party establishment, but with electoral politics in general. Just as Roy Moore was the spoiler to Luther Strange and Mo Brooks in Alabama, and Donald Trump was the spoiler to Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, there just has to be that wild card upending the plot who doesn\u2019t say all of the right things but thrives on harvesting anti-establishment antipathy.\n\nOn the gun question, Blankenship quickly got it out of the way that he obviously wouldn\u2019t touch the Second Amendment. But then he made my favorite segue, in a night overflowing with self-aggrandizing segues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the Second Amendment that\u2019s under assault,\u201d he said. \u201cThe First Amendment\u2019s under assault.\u201d I expected a digression about the free-speech culture of college campuses\u2014and he would eventually get to that\u2014but Blankenship first turned instead to his own experience. \u201cThey put a gag order on me shortly after I was indicted,\u201d he said, positioning himself a free speech martyr, too.\n\nWhen he returned to the Second Amendment, Blankenship made another remark that qualifies as surprising in a West Virginia GOP primary.\n\n\u201cGuns are a problem in this country, because there\u2019s a lot of \u2018em,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think \u2026 that if we ban guns at this point, given as many as there are, that only the criminals will have guns, and I don\u2019t want to go there.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d heard a Republican politician so straightforwardly concede that the country\u2019s gun supply is the cause of its unique gun violence, even if he didn\u2019t arrive at a very radical solution. It was far more notable than the other candidates\u2019 canned responses, whether Morrisey\u2019s tale of casing out a middle school with the NRA or Jenkins describing how, when the House Republican conference reads aloud the Constitution on the floor at the beginning of each Congress, he gets to read the Second Amendment.\n\nBlankenship had another moment like this, too, when the candidates were asked about whether they would cut federal entitlements in a poor state that relies so heavily on them. Jenkins, in one of his bits, addressed West Virginians and pledged never to privatize Social Security or to cut Medicare. (He didn\u2019t mention Medicaid, for good reason.) Morrisey likewise said he wouldn\u2019t touch those programs for current recipients and would only go after the waste and fraud within Medicaid.\n\nWhen it was Blankenship\u2019s turn, he looked up from his notes.\n\n\u201cAt some point we\u2019re going to have to be a little bit older when we get Social Security,\u201d he said. The entitlement programs need to be addressed, he said, \u201cif you call them that. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really entitled to them.\u201d And then the conversation moved on.\n\nIf Blankenship is playing the role of a Roy Moore or a Donald Trump, it\u2019s an understated performance. His personality is nothing like theirs\u2014where Trump and Moore seemed to breathe publicity, Blankenship eschews the spotlight. During the debate, Blankenship seemed like he\u2019d rather be locked in a basement hideaway, alone, double-checking the math on a corporate accounting filing. If Blankenship wants his revenge against Joe Manchin, he\u2019ll need to give people a reason to watch.","19":"Interested in Gun Control? Add Gun Control as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Gun Control news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nSome residents of an Oregon county are asking voters to support a proposed ballot measure that would bar local officials from enforcing any gun control law and uphold gun rights outlined in the Constitution.\n\nThe proposed Second Amendment Preservation Ordinance was filed with the Deschutes County clerk last week. It would empower the county sheriff to review federal, state and local laws and determine whether they violate the U.S. or Oregon constitutions.\n\nIt appeared aimed at a statewide proposal that would essentially ban assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines in Oregon. Gun control advocates are collecting signatures to qualify that measure, Initiative Petition 43, for the November ballot.\n\nDeschutes County Sheriff Shane Nelson publicly opposed the proposal this month, saying Oregon already has laws on background checks and age restrictions. He noted that among those prohibited from buying a gun are convicted felons, those convicted of misdemeanor crimes involving violence, and those found to be mentally ill.\n\n\"I support and defend the Second Amendment and oppose IP 43,\" Nelson wrote on the sheriff's office Facebook page.\n\nHe said he believes every law-abiding citizen who wants to legally own a firearm should do so.\n\nThe proposed county initiative would bar Deschutes County from using its funds or employees to enforce any rules \"that infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms.\"\n\nNelson said that while he supports \"the spirit of the ordinance,\" he doesn't support enacting it.\n\nDeschutes County tends to be conservative, with most rural voters having voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election. However, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton led voting in Bend, the county seat that has drawn many Californians and is a craft-brewing and outdoor recreation mecca.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https:\/\/twitter.com\/andrewselsky ."},"URL":{"0":"https:\/\/lifehacker.com\/a-gun-lingo-glossary-for-those-unfamiliar-with-firearms-1825427596","1":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/4\/25\/17275996\/cult-leaders-psychology-bhagwan-shree-rajneesh-netflix-wild-wild-country","2":"https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/inside-amds-quest-to-build-chips-that-can-beat-intel-1824064984","3":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/04\/24\/us\/gun-owners-laws-parkland.html","4":"https:\/\/mashable.com\/2018\/04\/25\/water-pistol-emoji-google-facebook\/","5":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/25\/opinions\/mick-mulvaney-delivers-the-chilling-truth-sachs\/index.html","6":"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/best-heat-protectant","7":"https:\/\/www.tennessean.com\/story\/news\/2018\/04\/25\/waffle-house-shooting-suspect-travis-reinking-mental-health-gun-laws\/546370002","8":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2018\/apr\/24\/trump-iran-deal-macron-new-agreement-white-house-visit","9":"https:\/\/hackaday.com\/2018\/04\/25\/retrotechtacular-synchros-go-to-war-and-peace\/","10":"http:\/\/time.com\/5253700\/matthew-mcconaughey-march-for-our-lives\/","11":"http:\/\/time.com\/5253441\/time-100-parkland-survivors\/","12":"http:\/\/time.com\/5248853\/parkland-survivor-david-hogg-at-time-100\/","13":"http:\/\/time.com\/5253337\/toronto-van-attack-alek-minassian-facebook\/","14":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/police-repeatedly-taser-airline-passenger-133051553.html","15":"http:\/\/time.com\/5254929\/toronto-van-attack-suspect-incel-women-rejection\/","16":"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/justin-bariso\/how-james-shaw-jr-hero-of-waffle-house-attack-used-emotional-intelligence-to-save-himself-others.html","17":"https:\/\/slate.com\/human-interest\/2018\/04\/dear-prudence-my-mother-and-i-are-pregnant-at-the-same-time.html","18":"https:\/\/slate.com\/news-and-politics\/2018\/04\/don-blankenship-is-the-national-gop-establishments-latest-archenemy.html","19":"http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/wireStory\/effort-oregon-county-ban-enforcing-gun-control-laws-54672405"}}
