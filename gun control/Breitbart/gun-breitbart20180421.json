{"Content":{"0":"There are a lot of gun terms thrown around in the media these days, like \u201cclip,\u201d \u201ccasings,\u201d and \u201csemi-automatic.\u201d But if you\u2019re not familiar with firearms, many of these terms might go over your head. This glossary of common gun lingo will help clear things up so you can be an informed part of the conversation.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, this is a sensitive subject, especially in light of the many recent tragedies that have occurred. But knowledge on the subject of guns is important\u2014no matter where you stand on the matter\u2014since misinformation does nothing but cause more confusion and frustration for everyone. Real discussion can only occur when we all understand the basic facts.\n\n\n\nIn alphabetical order, these are the gun terms you may not know:\n\nACP : An abbreviation of Automatic Colt Pistol. Designates various John Browning cartridge designs and calibers primarily used in Colt and Fabrique Nationale de Herstal semi-automatic pistols, like .45 ACP, .380 ACP, and .25 ACP.\n\n\n\n: An abbreviation of Automatic Colt Pistol.

AK-47 : An incredibly popular automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov, and first used in active service back in 1948. They are very reliable and cost very little to make so they\u2019re the gun of choice for many military and revolutionary outfits. As of 2004, \u201cOf the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov family, three-quarters of which are AK-47s\u201d\n\n\n\n: An incredibly popular automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov, and first used in active service back in 1948.

My life was fulfilled.\u201d\n\nRajneesh, who died in 1990, was a powerful spiritual guru who had thousands of followers in India and the West. In 1981, with the help of Sheela, who became his personal assistant, Rajneesh bought a ranch nearby the tiny town of Antelope, Oregon, and moved his cult there, creating a whole new city named Rajneeshpuram. It\u2019s no surprise that the situation snowballed, leading to heated confrontations with local residents, attempted murder, and mass poisoning. Wild Wild Country follows the saga in captivating ways, through historical footage as well as sit-down interviews with Sheela, who effectively ran the cult and was Rajneesh\u2019s spokesperson, and other members who had prominent roles, like Rajneesh\u2019s lawyer Swami Prem Niren.\n\nBut as Ronit Feinglass Plank notes in The Atlantic, the series doesn\u2019t really explain what the day-to-day life was like in Rajneeshpuram. And it doesn\u2019t really address how it\u2019s possible that thousands of people could just give up their lives, wear only maroon clothes, and blindly follow one man. What are the psychological mechanisms at play?\n\nRajneesh preached to his followers about the idea of creating awakened people who live in harmony with their surroundings. But his cult also forced members to donate large quantities of money, while creating an isolated community that kept tight control over its members. The Netflix documentary doesn\u2019t show this, but Win McCormack, who wrote about the cult in the 1980s, points out in The New Republic that Rajneesh\u2019s followers were encouraged to get sterilized or have abortions. (For more on Rajneesh and his cult, read The Oregonian\u2019s 20-part investigation from the 1980s.)\n\nRajneesh was just one of many cult leaders who have captivated \u2014 and horrified \u2014 people throughout history. In 1978, cult leader Jim Jones urged more than 900 of his followers to kill themselves by drinking poison in Jonestown, Guyana. In 1993, in a standoff with government officials, more than 75 Branch Davidians died in a building fire in Waco, Texas, together with their leader David Koresh. All of these groups, and many more less prominent cult organizations, have some things in common. I talked with Louis Manza, chair and professor of psychology at Lebanon Valley College about how cult leaders control their followers, when people are most vulnerable to cults, and the difference between cults and religions.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nHow do cult leaders like Rajneesh exert control over their followers?\n\nThey can take a lot of approaches, obviously. On a real simple level, they could take control in a very physical way, restraining someone from leaving a space, but that doesn\u2019t seem to happen a whole lot. It\u2019s more of a psychological control. If you look historically at different types of cults, there\u2019s always an indoctrination period where the cult leader is going to form a bond with people. Once they have that bond, now they can get inside of someone\u2019s head, because now those people start to trust that person. And now the leader can start to make other suggestions to them: \u201cYou should move away from your family.\u201d \u201cYou should come live with us.\u201d Etc. That\u2019s one of the critical things: there has to be that emotional connection that\u2019s made by the person who\u2019s running everything with the people they want to bring in with them. If you don\u2019t have that connection, it\u2019s going to be really hard to get people to do anything.\n\nWhat kinds of psychological mechanisms do cults use to keep their members in line?\n\nOnce someone forms a bond with a person, you can use that to your advantage, to a certain extent. You can withhold certain types of things. If you\u2019re the cult leader, [you can decide] we all get to meet at this point in time, and we all get to talk about our feelings, but you can\u2019t come this week because you\u2019ve been misbehaving, or you\u2019re not been pulling your share, or whatever the case might be. Once you have that relationship with that person, punishing [or rewarding] them can get something out of them. Again, it\u2019s not a physical-restraint type of thing, but it is a form of control.\n\nThey\u2019re also paying attention to what works, the same way that a spouse pays attention to what works with their significant other, the same way a parent pays attention with their kids. [Parents] can punish their children by making them stand in a corner for 10 minutes, and that works because that kid doesn\u2019t like to stand in a corner. But for another kid, that doesn\u2019t work, so they have to find something else. So they take the tablet away from them, or they don\u2019t let them watch television. People who are very good at understanding other people, are very good at paying attention, can get inside someone\u2019s head and then exploit that. But the person who\u2019s exploited has to be exploitable. If someone is in a good place psychologically, then they\u2019re most likely not going to be exploitable.\n\n\u201cPeople who are very good at understanding other people, are very good at paying attention, can get inside someone\u2019s head and then exploit that.\u201d\n\nWhen are people most vulnerable to a cult?\n\nOn a simple level, when they\u2019re in a state of psychological instability \u2014 if something is not quite right in their life, if they\u2019re missing something, especially on a relationship perspective. We are social creatures. There\u2019s going to be some variability there; some people like much larger social circles than others, some people like to live in a cabin in the woods by themselves. But the majority of us fall in the middle. It\u2019s part of what makes us humans. And so if that\u2019s missing for individuals, and they don\u2019t have a way of meeting that need on their own, they\u2019re going to look for someone else who can maybe provide that need for them. Now, lots of people will join \u201ccults\u201d as a way of satisfying that. Other people will join other types of groups.\n\nI compete in ultramarathons, so I do a couple races a year. And that kind of satisfies that need for me. Now, is that a cult? I don\u2019t think so, not in a way we define a cult, when you think of like the Jonestown massacre and Jim Jones. If you\u2019re into certain sports teams, that social need is being met there. It\u2019s just that idea that someone needs some type of social connection. I think it\u2019s one of the primary forces. If they simply can\u2019t find a way on their own to fulfill that, and then someone comes along and says, \u201cHey, we have this group. And you\u2019re welcome. Join us!\u201d it can be a very subtle thing at first. If you want to get someone in, and you know how to manipulate people, it\u2019s fairly simple to do: you bring them in, you establish the relationship, and then you just start sucking them in more and more, and eventually, someone just crosses a line and they\u2019re in. And then they can have a hard time getting out, because now they have that social need being met. It can be a very subtle process along those lines.\n\nWhat do cult leaders have in common?\n\nThey tend to be charismatic. Historically, if you think of the people we call cult leaders, like David Koresh, James Jones, they all had a certain charisma. That goes back to what I was saying about forming social bonds. If you can\u2019t attract people to you, then you\u2019re going to be hard-pressed to form a cult. Beyond that, it\u2019s going to depend. You have to understand people, you gotta know what\u2019s going on inside of their heads, you gotta talk to them, you gotta be able to pull information out of them. Those are skills. All of us use them in different ways. I\u2019ve been teaching since 1992, so I know if I do this, I will get students to interact in class. Is that a form of manipulation? Sure it is. I wouldn\u2019t put it up with the same kind of manipulation that a cult leader is doing, but they are also doing that. They\u2019re understanding people, they\u2019re studying people. They develop that kind of skill-set, but I think charisma has to be at the top of it, because just knowing people, it\u2019s a skill people can acquire. Being charismatic and understanding people, that\u2019s another thing altogether.\n\nPeople who are in power also like to keep that power, and they don\u2019t want to give that power up. The cult leader wants to control people, to a certain degree. When you look at people who run these organizations, if you look at the more historically famous ones, they had a need to control people, and when that control got pushed up against, they pushed back. When David Koresh and the Branch Davidians went down, Koresh didn\u2019t want to give up control of those people. And you had the gun fight and the burning of a building and all that. Jim Jones didn\u2019t want give up control of those hundreds of people in Jonestown, and people died. I think wanting to control is a driving force from the leader, and wanting to belong is the driving force for the member. You put those things together, you create the perfect storm for getting people into a cult.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a cult and a religion?\n\nReligions are an organized belief system, and cults are organized belief systems. People will engage in lots of behaviors on the part of their religion, that can be very good but it can also be very bad. People have killed other individuals in the name of their religion. Now, will Catholics prevent you from leaving the church? Not to my knowledge. I was raised Catholic. I\u2019m an atheist now. Now one held me back. So what we usually consider cults tend to exert a bit more control over their members, but that\u2019s not to say that that control doesn\u2019t happen in more organized, traditional religions. But with cults, you see that real psychological, physical-restraint thing kick in to a much higher degree than you see in Catholics, Lutherans, or whatever. If there is a dividing line, it\u2019s along those lines, but they definitely share a lot of features, because they\u2019re organized belief systems.\n\nBut there are lot of things that are not even religions or cults that are organized belief systems. Again, if you\u2019re part of a certain sports team, you have an organized belief system. But mental manipulation, psychological manipulation is something you tend to see more in cults than in organized religion.","2":"There are few gambles in the tech world as big spending billions to build a new computer processor from scratch. Former AMD board member Robert Palmer supposedly compared it to Russian roulette: \u201cYou put a gun to your head, pull the trigger, and find out four years later if you blew your brains out.\u201d Six years ago AMD loaded the gun and pulled the trigger, dramatically restructuring itself internally in a mad bid to escape a disaster of its own making. Now we\u2019ve seen the results and instead of dying, AMD has a savvy new CPU microarchitecture, Zen, that\u2019s the foundation of the shockingly good new series of Ryzen processors. They\u2019re so good, in fact, that they could pose a real challenge to Intel\u2019s incumbent dominance and change what the computer market looks for the next few years.\n\n\u201cI think Intel kind of woke up and said \u2018hey you know we\u2019re in a battle all of a sudden,\u2019\u201d Linley Gwenapp, an analyst, and editor of the Microprocessor Report, an industry magazine, told Gizmodo. \u201cSo they\u2019re not going to just stand by and let AMD storm into the market.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Intel has its work cut out for it. In January at CES in Las Vegas, I met with both companies and the mood could not have been more different. Intel seemed to spend the entire consumer electronics show apologizing for Spectre and Meltdown, a series of catastrophic security vulnerabilities that affected every one of the company\u2019s CPUs. It seemed to barely have time to tease all the cool stuff it had coming out in the next few months. AMD, meanwhile, was a peacock\u2014fluttering its feathers and bragging about its plans to continue one of the most aggressive launches in CPU history. The fact that it was vulnerable to Meltdown was almost an aside. AMD was way too busy being thrilled to be back, doing something very cool, and not being the one with all the bad press for once.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s been very successful when you look at where they were a year ago,\u201d Gwenapp said of AMD. Because even just a year ago the company was in rough shape. According to Gwenapp, AMD had as little as 1.5 percent of the server market share last year. Intel had the other 98.5 percent. Sure it was making the chips that power every single Xbox One and PS4, and yes it\u2019s the exclusive provider of GPUs for Apple machines, but to anyone who was paying attention, it sure seemed like AMD was a shadow of its former self. After all, the company was once considered Intel\u2019s only serious rival in the CPU space, and until Zen was announced, AMD had been virtually silent on that front, effectively capitulating the multi-billion market for the chips that serve as the brains for everything from your computer to the servers powering your favorite websites.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Gizmodo\n\nAMD\u2019s last big push in the CPU space came with a microarchitecture called Bulldozer back in 2011. In the tech world that\u2019s an eternity. To put it in perspective, the same year AMD was last seriously attempting to compete with Intel, Apple launched the iPhone 4s, and Intel launched the second generation of its Core architecture. Intel is now on generation eight and expected to launch its ninth by the end of the year. It\u2019s been eons since Intel and AMD were serious competitors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the biggest reasons it\u2019s taken so long for AMD to compete again is because that last big CPU launch was disastrous. Bulldozer obviously wasn\u2019t intended to be awful. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as if somebody architected something that people thought wouldn\u2019t be successful,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, Founder and Prinicipal Anaylyst at Moorhead Strategy, told Gizmodo. Before becoming an analyst, Moorhead was a VP at AMD for nearly 10 years and departed at the same time Bulldozer came to market.\n\nAccording to Moorhead, Bulldozer was always intended to be a high octane kind of CPU that blazed past its Intel competitors thanks to its high clock rate (or clockspeed). The higher the clockspeed the more cycles of processing a CPU can potentially undergo in a second, and according to Moorhead, AMD had planned a clock rate of 5GHz, which is over five billion processes every second. Intel\u2019s competitor at the time shipped CPUs with a much lower clockrate\u2014only a handful could hit 4GHz.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why when people say \u2018oh we didn\u2019t get out of Bulldozer what we would have wanted\u2019 it\u2019s because that was supposed to be a very high frequency part,\u201d Moorhead said. In fact no CPU in general production from AMD or Intel has ever hit a clockrate of 5Ghz or higher. The only CPU to ever go into production with such a high clockrate is the IBM zEC12 released in 2012 and intended solely for IBM mainframes.\n\n\u201cIt was never really competitive.\u201d\n\nWhen Bulldozer went into production it had a base clockrate of just 4.2GHz with a turbo clock rate (which is enabled when the processor needs to crank through a little data very quickly) of 4.5GHz. And the respectable clock rate couldn\u2019t compete with Intel\u2019s offerings in the same space. The reaction from reviewers was brutal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnandtech\u2019s Anand Lal Shimpi wrote that he was \u201cnot sure it\u2019s quite ready for prime time\u201d and that \u201cBulldozer simply does not perform.\u201d Tom\u2019s Hardware noted that it was often \u201cembarrassingly bested by its predecessor\u201d while Tweaktown lamented that \u201cyou can\u2019t help but almost feel disappointed with what\u2019s going on here today.\u201d\n\nWhen CNET did a round up of the geekier reviews of Bulldozer it reported that \u201cBulldozer does not appear to offer AMD a competitive resurgence.\u201d But it was at least a little hopeful AMD could stick around in the CPU space, if for no other reason than \u201cto keep Intel honest.\u201d\n\nYet that didn\u2019t happen. AMD had come out of the gate with a troubled architecture and the gap between it and Intel only grew wider over each successive annual iteration. The company tried \u201cto start with something that doesn\u2019t work well and then kludge it up to make it better,\u201d Gwenapp told Gizmodo. But with each new iteration based on the already underperforming Bulldozer architecture it couldn\u2019t keep up. \u201cIt never really was competitive.\u201d\n\nIt takes guts\n\nAnd a CPU absolutely must be competitive\u2014either cheaper, faster, or more power efficient. It is the core brain that powers every computer you use\u2014from your phone to your laptop to your TV. A CPU defined by its microprocessor\u2014which is in many cases a synonym for CPU. It\u2019s a wafer of silicon that then has billions of microcircuits etched to its surface and connected to one another via ions of copper. The specific way a CPU\u2019s silicon microcircuits\u2014or transistors\u2014are arranged and connected via copper is called its \u201carchitecture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe very first microprocessor, the Intel 4004 released in 1971, was built on a die, or foundation, that was just 10,000nm. That is as thick as a very thin strand of human hair. The Ryzen CPU is just 14nm. A small process means it can move energy across those copper ions faster\u2014effectively meaning that the smaller a CPU gets the faster it can be. But the smaller a CPU is the more delicate it becomes. So in the bid to make the fastest and most powerful processors, CPU designers must also make them smaller and more intricate. And that means always optimizing and seeking better efficiencies.\n\nConsequently each CPU is designed for a specific \u201cinstruction set.\u201d That is the most basic code that works between a CPU and a devices software. Common CPU instruction sets you\u2019ve heard of are ARM and x86. ARM CPUs are usually found in phones and tablets\u2014the CPUs that power you Samsung GalaxyS9 and your iPhone X are ARM-based processors. x86 CPUs are usually reserved for computing devices that need a lot more power and a little less battery life. Intel and AMD\u2019s CPUs for laptops, desktops, and servers are x86, and unless specifically specified, as are AMD\u2019s competitors, including its new batch of Ryzen processors.\n\nBeyond the instruction set CPUs, are actually pretty simple and just made up of a few key components: cores, CPU caches, and the system bus. The cores are the engine of the CPU, they\u2019re the things doing all the actual processing and when you talk about the clockrate of a CPU you\u2019re talking about how fast those cores are operating. The cores do all the actual processing required by the CPU, but they\u2019re very busy processing all that data you feed them, so they need to cache bits of it away for super quick references.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is where CPU caches come in. They are the memory. When you glance at the specs for a computer you\u2019re planning to buy you might see a mention of these caches, usually labelled L1, L2, and L3. They\u2019re important because they\u2019re what the cores actually read and write data to while processing. That data, after being processed on the CPU caches, is then sent back out to the general memory (also known as RAM) for the computer, and then possibly onto the storage drive, and it all gets to your eyeballs because it goes through the graphics processing unit.\n\nThe CPU caches and the cores communicate to one another via the system bus. It\u2019s called a bus because it\u2019s essentially busing information from one part of the CPU to another. And sometimes it\u2019s not just moving data between the cores and the CPU caches. A system bus will also move data to and from a graphics processor if its squeezed onto the same chip too. At its most rudimentary, consider a system bus to be like that little green board you used to snap all the Lego bricks onto.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are a lot of different kinds of system buses, and every major CPU maker has their own system bus architecture. So Intel has what it calls Front Side Bus, and until Zen, AMD used tech called HyperTransport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, focusing on any one of these components can improve the speed of a CPU,. When AMD created Bulldozer it put all its effort into the clockrate of the cores of the CPU. The clockrate is the frequency at which a computer processing unit can actually process cycles of data. More processes means a faster CPU and for a very long time improving the clockrate of a CPU was the primary goal of designers.\n\nBut in the early 2000s, Intel brought a CPU to market with a clockrate of 3GHz, and since then nearly all CPUs have hovered around that clockrate. One of the reasons for that stall in clockrate increases is because the higher the clockrate the more heat the CPU produces. Getting rid of all that heat can be costly\u2014especially if you\u2019re trying to pack that CPU into something super slim and fanless like a Surface Pro.\n\nSo in recent years, CPU designers have turned other parts of the CPU to improve speed, and when AMD made the decision to essentially scrap Bulldozer and put most of its resources into what would be come Zen, one particular component of the CPU would get a brunt of the focus: A new system bus architecture called Infinity Fabric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut before AMD settled on Infinity Fabric, before it even settled on creating a new CPU and acknowledging Bulldozer\u2019s failure, the company needed a new CPU design team.\n\nPhoto: Alex Cranz (Gizmodo)\n\nTheir powers combined\n\nEnter Mark Papermaster, current Chief Technology Officer for AMD. He joined the company in late 2011, just after Bulldozer\u2019s launch, and according to him \u201cit was not a coincidence.\u201d Papermaster had been brought in to help save a company that saw its stock prices plummet more than 60-percent in a year thanks in part to Bulldozer\u2019s poor performance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore joining AMD Papermaster was primarily noteworthy for two things. In 2008 he was the subject of a highly publicized lawsuit with IBM, where he\u2019d worked since 1982. IBM was concerned that Papermaster, then a recent hire at Apple, would potentially carry trade secrets with him from IBM to Apple. The case settled out of court. Then Papermaster made headlines again in 2010, when he reportedly left Apple after just 15 months due to disagreements with then CEO Steve Jobs.\n\nPapermaster entered AMD in October 2011 and the company seemed to be in a state of free fall, with major rivals like Qualcomm, Apple, and Samsung snapping up dissatisfied employees. The flight of employees struck a nerve with some. \u201cThat just breaks my heart,\u201d former AMD founder Jerry Sanders told Forbes in February 2012.\n\nThe company was in disarray and Papermaster was himself contributing to it. Not because of his previous reputation, but because one of his first orders of business was to dramatically restructure the CPU design team. He\u2019d seen how bad Bulldozer was doing and it was clear to him it wasn\u2019t the processor AMD needed to succeed. \u201cI saw the market going to high performance,\u201d he told Gizmodo. \u201cTo do that we needed a new CPU.\u201d Instead of something that could just handle your web browsing, Papermaster was certain the market needed something that could handle gaming, or processing huge 3D files, or rendering big 4K videos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for Papermaster, a new CPU meant a major restructuring of AMD\u2019s design group. Traditionally the CPU design group was was broken up into two basic teams. \u201cPrior to the Zen architecture they really had two kind of parallel design tracks,\u201d Natalie Jerger, a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, told Gizmodo. One processor was intended for low powered laptops and desktops\u2014the cheapest of the cheap. The other was intended for servers and high end desktops. The server class processors were Bulldozer, and the low power CPUs were what was called the Bobcat family.\n\n\u201cAnd so what [Papermaster] did was he merged these two teams together,\u201d Joe Macri, Corporate Vice President and Product CTO at AMD, told Gizmodo. Macri was one of the leaders of that new, larger team.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo hear him tell it, the merging of the two teams (and the removal of anyone made redundant) seemed like a necessity for the task Papermaster assigned to the larger group. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to start from scratch,\u201d Macri said. \u201cSo that was really more of a merge than taking an existing team, rip it apart, and put it back together. But in the process we got a lot of efficiencies. We were able to apply more people to a single function and get much more design bandwidth.\u201d Bandwidth that would be necessary to accomplish Papermaster\u2019s goal of building a CPU that was in every way better than that rubbish it had just released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPapermaster was soon aided by another new exec at AMD: Lisa Su, who joined as Senior Vice President and General Manager in January 2012. Su had come from Freescale, another CPU maker that has since merged with NXP Semiconductors. Her first focus was on AMD\u2019s graphics and gaming markets\u2014where the company was actually having some successes. Su and then CEO Rory Read, secured deals with both Sony and Microsoft to create the chips at the heart of the Playstation 4 and Xbox One.\n\nThose deals were enormous, and many sources cite AMD\u2019s work on custom chips for Sony and Microsoft as one of the reasons the company both survived the CPU drought and actually managed to produce such an effective CPU with its current architecture, Zen.\n\nSu\u2019s work earned her quick notice and by October of 2014, a little more than two years after she\u2019d joined AMD, she was elevated to CEO. Su and Papermaster then proceeded to pour resources into the development of Zen. According to Macri it was over two million man hours spread over four years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Papermaster, putting all those resources into a new CPU design, and having that team effectively ignore Bulldozer and its successive iterations, was absolutely vital. He needed a team that would have the breathing room \u201cto get those bright ideas that they had.\u201d He felt that some of AMD\u2019s coolest ideas for new CPUs \u201chad been on the shelf because there had been such a demanding schedule of new revision after new revision.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou know sometimes you can get a \u2018let\u2019s do a from scratch design and throw everything out.\u2019 The team didn\u2019t do that.\u201d Instead the team pulled from AMD\u2019s extensive back catalog to use ideas that hadn\u2019t been given a lot of focus over the years. One such idea was improving on the system bus architecture HyperTransport and creating a new one: Infinity Fabric.\n\n\n\nMark Papermaster told Gizmodo AMD called it \u201cthe hidden gem,\u201d while Jim Anderson told Gizmodo it was the \u201csecret sauce.\u201d\n\nMr. Infinity\n\nThis is where a talented engineer named Jim Keller comes in. He\u2019s a mythical sort of figure within AMD. Nearly every person I spoke to cited Keller as one of the primary people behind the success of Zen\u2019s design, and importantly behind the design of Infinity Fabric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPapermaster hired Keller in 2012 and put him in charge of the processor group. Keller was no stranger to AMD. He\u2019d worked there previously in the \u201890s and his short tenure had achieved legendary status in the geeky processor community online where he is credited as the principal figure behind AMD\u2019s K8 microarchitecture which allowed the company to be viciously competitive with Intel in the late \u201890s and early 2000s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeller and Papermaster had worked at Apple together, where Keller is credited with designing the first CPUs Apple built itself for its iPhones and iPads. When he came to AMD, both he and his new employer agreed to come under a limited time contract. He would work at AMD for three years, and at the end of that contract he would depart, which he did in 2015. He now designs chips for the autopilot feature in Tesla\u2019s cars, and declined to comment for this story. [Update: The morning of publication, Intel announced that Jim Keller had jointed the company as the SVP for Silicon Engineering. The plot thickens!]\n\nKeller, and in particular his work on mobile CPUs and previous work on HyperTransport, were key. Without Keller to speak for himself we\u2019re left with glowing praise from AMD execs like Mark Papermaster and Jim Anderson, and from analysts like Linley Gwenapp who said \u201cI think Jim and his team really has turned around the company from a technology standpoint.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a rare public interview in 2014 with Papermaster, you start to get a sense of Keller\u2019s enthusiasm and motivation. \u201cI joined AMD because I love processor design and I love complicated systems design and AMD was looking at taking a big swing on the next generation,\u201d Keller said.\n\nKeller seems calm and polished up on the little stage, but he tends to ramp up in response to geekier questions\u2014growing sharper and more and more animated as he talks about architectures and pipelines and cores and the other supremely technical stuff that most of us would yawn at.\n\nThe interview is a great look at where Zen was in 2014\u2014three years before its launch. At the time it was only approximately two years into its development, and still being designed alongside K12\u2014AMD\u2019s planned next generation ARM CPU. In the interview, Keller actually cites that co-development as an asset to Zen and specifically to the cores at the heart of each Zen CPU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever Keller doesn\u2019t hint at the most important component until near the end of the 15 minute session when he mentions a next generation \u201cfabric\u201d that would be found in every CPU from mobile devices up to servers and that would allow AMD to scale performance at an enviable rate. That fabric would be known, by 2017, as Infinity Fabric.\n\n\u201cAMD has found a way to have their cake and eat it too.\u201d\n\nHe explains that the fabric would allow AMD to employ a \u201cchiplet\u201d approach to design. Instead of building one processor on a single die AMD could package a series of processors together\u2014connecting them via the Infinity Fabric system bus. This would make the CPUs way cheaper to produce and ideally as fast as a CPU, like AMD\u2019s previous CPUs and most of the ones from Intel, that included all the cores on a one die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHistorically,\u201d analyst Patrick Moorhead told Gizmodo, \u201cwhen you put things in packages it slows down the process. But AMD has found a way to have their cake and eat it too by coming up with this packaging that sets very high performance.\u201d\n\nAnd this packaging also meant AMD was designing a very different kind of CPU from its competitor, with a different, and according to AMD, much more efficient methodology. \u201cWe came up with a very regular structure for it,\u201d Joe Macri told Gizmodo. \u201cWe basically had a data point and a control point and everybody that bolted into [Infinity Fabric] bolted into it the same way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMacri claims Infinity Fabric actually sped up design of the processors across the board. The modular design it gave the Zen architecture meant AMD didn\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel for every kind of CPU. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges in designing a core is actually validating it,\u201d Macri said. And thanks to Infinity Fabric AMD could quickly validate, or confirm the operation of, a whole slew of slightly varied designs ranging across their entire offering of Zen processors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink of Infinity Fabric as the little snaps in Lego blocks and all the components of a CPU as the blocks themselves. AMD could take a few blocks to build a desktop CPU, or tack on more to create a big multi-core server processor, or snap on a GPU to make a wicked fast chip intended for laptops.\n\nOr, as happened in 2016\u2014an entirely new type of CPU for AMD.\n\nImage: Gizmodo\n\nThe breakthrough\n\nReleased in 2017, Threadripper\u2014AMD\u2019s perhaps most eye catching CPU launched on Zen\u2014was never on any of Papermaster\u2019s aggressive roadmaps. Instead it was a passion project by a very small group of engineers\u2014like maybe four. A \u201cvery, very small group,\u201d Robert Hallock, AMD Evangelist for APUs and CPUs said. He shared the same row of cubicles with them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company had wanted to do a really big and powerful desktop CPU for a while, but it had never been feasible technologically or financially speaking. Yet this tiny group of engineers realized that they could potentially take advantage of the chiplet design made possible by Infinity Fabric to build an incredibly powerful desktop CPU to rival Intel\u2019s popular top-end Xeon CPUs. Yet instead of the 8 cores found on the Xeon processors used in beefy workstations, the Threadripper would have a whopping 16 cores\u2014the most ever put in a mass-produced desktop CPU.\n\nSuch a CPU should take years to design, test, and push into the market place right? According to Jim Anderson the tiny team didn\u2019t even approach him about it until January 2016, when they pulled him aside during CES in Las Vegas. He said he immediately recognized the sheer cool factor of these chips and insisted on putting the project on a fast track, taking it from their concept to production in just a little over a year.\n\nThe project was steeped in secrecy, referred to only as Summit P3\u2014which many assumed was a minor offshoot of Ryzen\u2014then call Summit Ridge, and according to Hallock \u201cyou were not even allowed to send emails\u201d about the project. Everything, from the look to the speed results were closely guarded until launch and even the teams trying to convince PC makers like Dell to adopt the CPU had almost no details on the product itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet when Threadripper did finally launch in the summer of 2017, it shocked critics and consumers alike, and was quickly adopted by some of the largest PC makers in the world, including Alienware\u2019s top-of-the-line gaming desktops.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the audacity of Threadripper\u2019s design that intrigued people. Yes 16 cores running 32 threads in a desktop PC anyone can build is impressive, but Intel announced an 18-core i9 processor just two weeks after Threadripper was announced. What was surprising was that it was cheap\u2014$1,000 to the $2,000 for Intel\u2019s 18-core processor\u2014and the damn thing was actually as fast.\n\nPhoto: Gizmodo\n\nMore than anything else, this is what has surprised observers about AMD\u2019s latest CPU architecture: The chips are cheaper and usually faster than their Intel competition. You can look at our own reviews of AMD processors over the last year as proof (here, here, and here).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet AMD isn\u2019t just producing fast, cheap processors processors, it\u2019s also releasing them all of a sudden at a surprisingly fast clip. In 2017 AMD released four categories of CPUs based on Zen: Ryzen desktop CPUs, Threadripper, Epyc CPUs intended for servers, and Ryzen APUs for laptops (APU is the AMD term for a CPU with integrated graphics). We\u2019re only four months into 2018 and AMD has already released incredibly fast and cheap APUs for the desktop, additional mobile APUs for laptops, and even a second generation of Ryzen CPUs for desktops.\n\nJim Anderson told Gizmodo he anticipates over 60 new laptops and desktops with Ryzen inside by the end of the year, with most of those systems being laptops, and most of those laptops coming in the next few months. \u201cThis will be the widest range of premium notebook systems that you\u2019ve ever seen from AMD in the company\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nHow good those laptops are remains to be seen. So far there are only a handful of AMD-based laptops actually in the marketplace, and we still don\u2019t have a good sense of how well a mobile Zen processor handles power compared to its Intel rival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if it\u2019s not quite as good at power management, it\u2019s still okay. Because Intel has clearly noticed AMD\u2019s strides into the CPU space and has responded accordingly. Last year Intel\u2019s top of the line desktop CPU maxed out at 4 cores, but after AMD released a 6-core processor Intel quickly responded with its own 6-core device. And when AMD surprised us with the 16-core Threadripper, Intel raced to get the 18-core i9 into the marketplace.\n\nA rivalry between the two companies can only ever be good for all of us hunting for our next computer. \u201cYou know,\u201d Natalie Jerger told Gizmodo, \u201cthe the world is much more exciting if we have multiple people trying to innovate in this space.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis post has been updated to reflect that former AMD-engineer Jim Keller has moved on to Intel from Tesla.","3":"As young survivors of the Parkland shooting lead efforts to tighten limits on firearms, they have met deep resistance from strong supporters of gun rights, and both sides have dug in. But the renewed national gun debate \u2014 reignited again after the shooting in the Nashville Waffle House \u2014 has gotten the attention of a subset of people who are often overlooked: gun control supporters who own guns.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany of these gun owners will never take part in marches or make public speeches. But interviews with two dozen gun owners around the country found what polls have shown \u2014 that many of them are firm supporters of some gun control measures. In recent weeks, some have grown more vocal, holding signs at demonstrations, lobbying lawmakers or writing letters to the editor, adding their voices to those of the protesting students.\n\nOf the 60 million to 70 million Americans who own guns, measuring how many are likely to take part in activism in favor of gun control or to change their political choices over the issue is difficult. One rough proxy for those who do not want tougher gun laws could be the five million gun owners the National Rifle Association claims as members, said Robert Spitzer, the chairman of the political science department at the State University of New York at Cortland, who has written extensively about gun policy and politics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe N.R.A. is staunchly opposed to new gun control measures, and events following the Parkland shooting may have deepened the resolve of its supporters. In March, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the N.R.A. Political Victory Fund raised $2.35 million \u2014 the highest monthly amount raised for the fund in records dating back to 2003, according to an analysis by the news outlet McClatchy and verified by The New York Times. The N.R.A. did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nOnly a small number of gun owners seem to be stepping forward in activism in favor of stricter gun laws, and not all agree about which laws should be toughened. But advocacy groups that support increased gun control say they sense a new kind of participation in more subtle ways, such as calls from gun owners wanting to know what the groups do, and a greater willingness to listen. The shift could also have political implications: Some gun owners said they are now paying closer attention to which political candidates receive money from the N.R.A., which takes a hard line against firearm limits.\n\n\n\nAfter the Parkland shooting, Lindsey Donovan, an Army veteran in Georgia who is a member of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said she began getting calls and inquiries from distant corners of that state, including gun shop owners in tiny towns \u201cwanting to talk about what it is we are about.\u201d Conversations about gun restrictions with friends in the military, she said, seemed to grow more searching and less combative.\n\n\u201cThey are not shutting me down anymore,\u201d Ms. Donovan said.\n\nBefore Parkland, her organization in Georgia had five local groups. Now there are 12. Around 1,800 people showed up to the organization\u2019s annual advocacy day in Atlanta in late February, up from 150 last year. And local chapter meetings used to draw around 30 people on any given night. Now it\u2019s often more than 100 showing up.\n\nDr. Spitzer said gun owners who favor gun limits reflect an often-silent middle who could be powerful allies for gun control groups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dog that doesn\u2019t bark,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a voice that\u2019s not heard.\u201d\n\nLong before Parkland, he said, gun owners who are not members of the N.R.A. have tended to see things differently than members. A 2009 survey by Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, found that 30 percent of N.R.A. members supported a ban on assault weapons, compared with 47 percent of gun owners who were not members \u2014 closer to the views of the general public in such polls.\n\nSurvey data has long shown gun owners to be broadly supportive of some restrictions on firearms. Polling just after the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland suggested a small uptick in support for stronger gun laws in gun-owning households. A poll by Quinnipiac University between Feb. 16 and 19 found that 50 percent of respondents in gun-owning households supported stricter gun laws \u2014 a figure that was seven percentage points higher than when people were asked the same question last December. In February, 97 percent of respondents in gun-owning households said they supported background checks for all gun buyers, compared with 94 percent in December. (The 1994 Brady Bill created a requirement for gun buyers to pass a background check, but the rule does not apply to private sellers online or at gun shows.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWith the N.R.A. opposed to expanding background checks, gun control groups have focused on the issue as a way to reach out to gun owners.\n\nWhen the gun control advocacy organization founded by Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman who in 2011 was shot in the head during an event with constituents, wanted to marshal support for a raft of proposed gun laws in Vermont, the organization worked with a local consultant, who reached out to gun owners. Before long, 61 gun owners in the state, including Mr. Galinat, had signed on to a letter to lawmakers, urging them to expand background checks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an ardent advocate for the Second Amendment, and none of those gun safety measures threaten any of those things that I believe in,\u201d said Mr. Galinat, who also went to Montpelier for a news conference on the issue. He said his only quibble with the letter, which was written by the consultant and a local gun safety group, was that he wanted lawmakers to set even stronger gun limits.\n\nSome gun owners said the Parkland shooting motivated them to be more vocal about their support for background checks, or about long simmering discontent with the N.R.A.\n\n\u201cWhat put me over the edge was this series of recent tragedies, both in schools and in other areas, and they just never budged,\u201d John S. Liccardi said of the N.R.A. Mr. Liccardi, 73, a hunter from Rutland, Vt., who owns several guns, stepped publicly into the gun debate for the first time in March. He denounced the N.R.A. in an op-ed for the news website VTDigger.\n\n\u201cIf there ever is going to be any progress in sensible gun ownership and control,\u201d Mr. Liccardi said, \u201cit has to be from the middle ground.\u201d\n\nSome members of gun-owning families have entered the debate hesitantly. Karen Fowkes from Vienna, Va., joined a sea of people at the March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C., last month. Her husband owned a gun, she said, and she initially worried about feeling hypocritical, but joined her daughter, Colleen, at the march after some convincing.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Mom, this is not an anti-gun march,\u2019\u201d the younger Ms. Fowkes said. \u201cI asked, \u2018Are you for universal background checks?\u2019 She said, \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo that, the younger Ms. Fowkes told her mother, \u201cYou are for gun control, too!\u201d\n\nBut for other gun owners, the marches had the opposite effect.\n\n\u201cI have a little bit more trepidation now,\u201d said Rob Mason, 47, an educational aide at a high school in Maineville, Ohio, outside Cincinnati, who owns several guns and practices shooting with his children at a range. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s going too far.\u201d\n\nMr. Mason, who is not an N.R.A. member, said he supports universal background checks. But he is uncomfortable with the notion of an assault-rifle ban. His daughter, Grace, who is 16, went to a march in Ohio. He was proud she participated. But he also felt worried. The marchers\u2019 demands seemed fluid and ill-defined, raising the worry that the young people simply wanted to ban all guns.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAs a moderate, I\u2019m like, \u2018Hmmm, are they really just pushing for one type of gun to be banned, or are they pushing for everything?\u2019\u201d Mr. Mason said. \u201cThe protesters are not talking to me. I don\u2019t think they believe that there are people like me out there.\u201d","4":"NASHVILLE \u2014 There is something fundamentally democratic about a Waffle House restaurant in the wee hours of the morning. It\u2019s a place where people working the late shift can stop for a hot meal on the way home, where high school kids can extend prom night just an hour longer, where 20-somethings jazzed on live music can wind down after a night on the town. The coffee is always fresh, and the counter staff has heard it all before but will usually listen again if you need an ear. It\u2019s a uniquely American place.\n\nThere\u2019s something tragically, fundamentally American, too, about an angry young white man with a firearm killing a bunch of strangers who have done him no harm. That\u2019s what happened early Sunday morning, when a man who was naked except for a green jacket loaded with ammunition opened fire with an AR-15 rifle at a Waffle House in the Antioch section of Nashville. Four people were fatally shot and four others were wounded before James Shaw Jr., an unarmed customer, wrestled the gun from him, saving untold lives.\n\nThe attacker ran away, shedding the jacket as he fled. Also left in his wake: Akilah Dasilva, DeEbony Groves, Joe Perez, and Taurean C. Sanderlin, all dead. All were in their 20s. All were people of color.\n\nA search of the truck the gunman left behind led investigators to Travis Reinking, an Illinois man who had moved to Nashville only last fall. Considered armed and dangerous, Mr. Reinking immediately went to the top of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation\u2019s most-wanted list. After some 34 hours at large in a cold rain, he was apprehended Monday afternoon clothed and wearing a backpack containing a loaded semiautomatic handgun.","5":"Tragedy struck the Antioch neighborhood of Nashville early Sunday morning when an armed man shot two individuals outside of a Waffle House before proceeding inside and killing two more.\n\nIn the face of that horror, reports the Tennessean, one Waffle House customer, 29-year-old James Shaw Jr., managed to wrestle an AR-15 rifle free from the shooter and likely saved lives in the process.\n\nNow, although Shaw is quick to brush the claim aside, he is being hailed as a hero.\n\nJames Shaw Jr. was identified as the hero who helped stop the Waffle House shooter this morning.

Well, almost.\n\nOn Wednesday, Google rolled out an Android update for the emoji keyboard that replaces the gun emoji with a \"toy water pistol.\" And according to Emojipedia, a similar change is imminent on Facebook.\n\nSEE ALSO: Apple is replacing the pistol emoji with a bright green squirt gun\n\nApple (via Unicode), Samsung, Twitter, and WhatsApp for Android have also all previously replaced guns with toy water pistols.\n\nEmojipedia reports that in the past, Google hedged on the change. But it has also emphasized its desire to be consistent with other platforms. That \"consistency\" is surely what drove this change \u2014 definitely not the gun control movement which has literally taken over the country in the wake of February's Parkland, FL shooting.\n\nIn 2016 when I asked if Google planned to change their gun emoji to a water pistol, the answer was \"we'll see\". Implied: we'll change ours, if or when others change theirs. And now they have. https:\/\/t.co\/lKzrMoSNys pic.twitter.com\/KGTlFLmOn9 \u2014 Jeremy Burge (@jeremyburge) April 24, 2018\n\nGoogle and Facebook's switch leaves one major player still with a straightforward, and not \"playful\" gun emoji option. That's Microsoft, on its Windows devices. Interestingly, though, Microsoft initially had a \"ray gun\" as its gun option. It only switched to a pistol in 2016 \u2014 the same year that Apple opted for a water gun option.\n\nAre toy guns much better tho? Just saying. Image: emojipedia\n\nRidding emoji keyboards of guns may sound like a trivial move in the effort to end gun violence \u2014 and it was a decision that certainly would irked some gun rights advocates. But with emoji more and more defining the way we speak to each other, and with the evidence that words and images impact the way that we actually think and act in the world, taking a gun out of our visual lexicon may be a more powerful act than it seems.","7":"Threatening murder to control your daughter's sex life is soooo funny, right?\n\nOh, wait, no it's not.

But there's also something to be said about the way Feely's \"joke\" denies his daughter's agency \u2014 which is to say, her ability to think and act as a free-thinking human capable of making her own decisions.\n\nThat kind of attitude should (in a just world) be as out of style as, well, treating a deadly weapon as a source of humor.\n\nThe Stoneman Douglas shooting was 2 months ago.\n\n\n\nBut sure, let's make jokes about murdering high schoolers. https:\/\/t.co\/Km3j9G4Ffn \u2014 Geraldine (@everywhereist) April 22, 2018\n\nOh yay - American dads have kicked off the season of \u201clet\u2019s pretend I\u2019m going to shoot my daughter\u2019s date for for impugning her chastity\u201d pics. https:\/\/t.co\/JRkhQTmKRV \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) April 22, 2018\n\nCool to know if your daughter has any self agency you\u2019ll shoot her boyfriend. \u2014 Ally Maynard (@missmayn) April 22, 2018\n\nFeely did tweet out a clarification, noting that it was all just a joke and that he takes \"gun safety seriously\" \u2014 adding that \"I did not intend to be insensitive to that important issue.\"\n\nThe prom picture I posted was obviously intended to be a joke.

As the former congressman and now interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau explained to bankers on Tuesday, \"We had a hierarchy in my office in Congress. If you're a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn't talk to you. If you're a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.\" Yes, Mulvaney would also meet his constituents from back home, whom he insists were at the top of the hierarchy.\n\nAmerica is a pay-to-play political system. When the lobbyists pay up, they're at the table. And to be sure, the big boys now run the show. The result is a political system among the most corrupt in the world, but with a twist of genius: the US Supreme Court has for all intents and purposes legalized the corruption and thereby put American democracy on a downward death spiral. The system works like this.\n\nAmerica's business interests, upper classes and white population have long made it hard for the poor and working class to register to vote. In most other democracies , voter registration is not the responsibility of individual voters, but is more or less automatic. Unlike these other democracies, US elections are a game of voter turnout, not of substance.\n\nAnd voter turnout efforts are based heavily on money -- big money -- to run ads on TV and other media, buy voter data, manage expensive targeting of households, and other big-ticket strategies.

Something along the lines of, my husband is uncircumcised \u2013 for now. She had jotted it down on the Notes app on her iPhone, where she keeps a lot of ideas, but it duplicated the note five times \u201cso now it looks like I really have plans to mutilate him,\u201d she says.\n\nShe then admits that she actually first used that line about another man she used to date, \u201cbut you have to update it so it\u2019s about the person you\u2019re with now. And really, my husband is good, he can keep everything he has. At this point in my life, I\u2019m cool with foreskin or not \u2013 God bless everyone and their penii,\u201d she says, breezily, as if she might have exhausted herself by creating a persona who is supposed to care so much.\n\nI think we should see more \u2013 I\u2019m not letting them retouch me in the film\n\nAmy Schumer is a conundrum. A native New Yorker, she made her incredibly successful name doing stand-up comedy about raw, rude sex and all of its discontents, about dating and dirtiness and blacking out drunk and doing the walk of shame home. Her TV sketch show, Inside Amy Schumer, ran for four series on Comedy Central and often mercilessly skewered the gender hypocrisy of what our culture allows men and women to do, in particular the beauty myths that silently surround women, in sketches such as \u201cGirl You Don\u2019t Need Makeup\u201d and \u201cHer Last Fuckable Day\u201d.\n\nAt the Glamour awards in London in 2015, after various female celebrities had tottered up to the stage to receive awards in heels they could barely walk in and dresses they could barely breathe in, Schumer strode on. \u201cI\u2019m probably 160lb right now,\u201d she said, looking out over the audience with disdain, \u201cand I can catch a dick whenever I want. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d I was there; she changed the mood of the room from faux modesty to explosive, spluttering laughter, and all the disdained women ran up to her afterwards, desperate to be her friend. It felt like a tipping point in that industry; famous women have been letting their guard down ever since.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stealing the show: Amy Schumer after bringing the house down at the Glamour awards. Photograph: David M Benett\/Getty Images\n\nYet a couple of months later, her debut movie Trainwreck came out, which she wrote and starred in. It began promisingly and originally, but ended with her character giving up her competitive career and literally becoming a cheerleader \u2013 an actual cheerleader \u2013 for her clever, high-achieving man. The next year Schumer published her autobiography, The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo, in which, alongside stories of a childhood going from riches to rags on Long Island with her dad\u2019s dodgy business skills and then illness, and both her parents\u2019 philandering, she wrote that, actually, she had only ever had a one-night stand once, and it was lovely and respectful, thank you very much.\n\nNow she has made I Feel Pretty, a film about a woman who gets a bash on the head and wrongly believes herself to have become as beautiful as a supermodel, and so creates a whole new life for her sexy self. The film asks if beauty is a state of mind \u2013 while also involving Schumeresque motifs such as a vaginal injury on an exercise bike.\n\nMeanwhile, Schumer has surprised the gossip papers by suddenly getting married, to a chef called Chris Fischer, in a lacy white wedding dress on a clifftop in Malibu. For celebrities, this is as traditional as your father walking you down the aisle in your village church. Coverage of the wedding made it all sound rather giddy and impulsive, but when I ask her about it, she is anything but.\n\n\u201cI feel exactly the same as before I was married \u2013 but I\u2019m psyched. I love him,\u201d she says, her face deadly serious, like she\u2019s been through a thing or two in this life. \u201cLike, I\u2019m fucking \u2013 it feels like having a partner. It feels like not being alone.\u201d We are sitting in a rather fancy hotel suite overlooking Central Park, where Schumer is promoting her new movie. Her bodyguard is in the next room, along with two assistants who have taken Schumer\u2019s tiny black poodle Tatiana, who was barking too much for the interview. \u201cHe\u2019s 38, I\u2019m 36, so, you know, we are not completing each other. We already are who we are and just want to support and encourage each other. And so I\u2019m psyched that I don\u2019t have to be zipping up my knee boots, leaving someone\u2019s apartment at 3am. I\u2019m done.\u201d She says this wasn\u2019t like other relationships, \u201cwhere you\u2019re like, come on, pleeease meet my parents. I can\u2019t believe I dealt with any of that bullshit before! This was like, oh my God I fucking love this person, and I admire him, and we\u2019re a team and he was ready.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I don\u2019t think of this movie as a love story. It\u2019s about her and her friends\u2019: with Rory Scovel in I Feel Pretty. Photograph: Mark Sch\u008afer\/STX Films\n\nI ask her if it is hard, having created such a bold sexual persona, ever to find the space to feel shy, but she looks baffled by that question and says that she isn\u2019t ever shy. In fact, she looks baffled by quite a few of my questions: interviews are clearly not her favourite thing. I want to discuss her work being about the concept of fuckability, but she says that that\u2019s not accurate, and turns her nose up a bit.\n\nShe says this film is about her character Renee simply wanting to be seen, and though there\u2019s a boyfriend angle, \u201cI don\u2019t think of this movie as a love story. It\u2019s about her and her friends.\u201d She says the dressing-up is for other women, because she has learned, with age, that we don\u2019t really dress for men. \u201cIn my experience, men are not that psyched and the guys that I\u2019m attracted to aren\u2019t the guys who are like, \u2018Oh, is that the new Givenchy line?\u2019 I think, her thing is about confidence and about feeling attractive.\u201d\n\nWhat the kids are just realising is that the adults are not actually in control\n\nWell, yes and no. I mean if it\u2019s all about women, then her character entering a bikini competition and shaking her stuff all over the stage in a dive bar full of men does seem an interesting move. Yet the thing about the bikini scene is \u2013 it becomes lovely. You start watching it behind your hands, cringing \u2013 and by the end you\u2019re charmed by the sight of someone just thoroughly, unabashedly enjoying herself.\n\nSchumer is glad I liked that scene, and says she fought for it. She was supposed to just stand there, \u201cbut I said no, I\u2019m going to go nuts on stage, I\u2019m going to dump water on myself, do the whole thing. And I seriously fought everybody and I\u2019m so glad I did.\u201d She also has a sex scene, and fought to be allowed to reveal more flesh but still have the film rated 13. \u201cI think we should see more, you know, and I\u2019m not letting them retouch any of me in the movie.\u201d\n\nThere is an idiosyncratic, pioneering power to Schumer\u2019s comedy work that I keep looking for in her films. They veer towards slapstick whereas her solo material has brains and guts. I do not make myself popular by suggesting this, and Schumer bristles when I ask what sort of movies she would make if there was no financial compulsion for feelgood endings.\n\n\u201cYou know, I said no to a movie where I would have made five times this amount of money,\u201d she says. Really? Someone else\u2019s project? \u201cMmm,\u201d she replies, mysteriously. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not so much about the money. Like, I wouldn\u2019t want to spend three years of my life working on The Revenant. I filmed a drama two years ago and it was a bummer. I don\u2019t want to show people what I can do \u2013 I just want to do stuff that will make people feel better.\u201d\n\nHot women, once the butt of her jokes, now get cast in her films. I Feel Pretty co-stars Emily Ratajkowski, who rose to fame dancing topless in the Blurred Lines music video, and also features a cameo from Naomi Campbell. \u201cI did a lot of press yesterday sitting next to Emily and I think that probably would have been kind of hard for me 10 years ago,\u201d she admits. They were wearing similar clothes, \u201cand I would have made a joke about it before \u2013 but now it\u2019s just \u2013 I just feel like that\u2019s over. I kind of feel done with the self-ranking thing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Black humour: Schumer\u2019s The Leather Special. Photograph: Marcus Price\/Netflix\n\nShe says this comes from growing up and realising that she feels most beautiful when she\u2019s away with her girls, or on a night out where she\u2019s just \u201cso happy, so comfortable, you know who you are. And then it\u2019s like, well, why can\u2019t we just feel like that all the time?\u201d One of those girls is her best buddy Jennifer Lawrence. \u201cI texted her yesterday and I was like, \u2018I did an interview today and I told them you were really hideous up close.\u2019 And she wrote, \u2018Actual LOL\u2019, and then she added in parenthesis \u2018(Because I\u2019m so pretty, you know?)\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Exactly.\u2019\u201d I ask about their shared sense of humour. \u201cWell, Jen\u2019s quick. She picks up on things that I just mutter to make myself laugh. I\u2019ll just say something under my breath, and she\u2019ll be like, \u2018I heard that.\u2019\u201d\n\nSpeaking of comic actors, Michelle Williams is an absolute revelation in I Feel Pretty. It\u2019s perhaps the biggest shock of the film. \u201cMe too,\u201d says Schumer. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she was really funny. Like she\u2019s really funny. Why didn\u2019t we know? It\u2019s because they always put her in some awful thing where she\u2019s got to be on the floor, crying.\u201d\n\nAs for the #MeToo movement, Schumer wholly supports it but isn\u2019t jumping up and down whooping about it \u201cbecause, while it\u2019s exciting, it\u2019s also really triggering and upsetting. It makes everybody feel super vulnerable. But to think that this generation is going to say, \u2018This isn\u2019t acceptable,\u2019 and not just bury the things that our mothers buried \u2013 that feels really good. It feels like, across the board, we\u2019re getting closer to equality. Which is \u2013 it\u2019s such a gut-wrenching thing to even have to say that.\u201d\n\nShe must have seen a few of her own male colleagues in comedy go down. \u201cRight, there are people you love that can have really shitty behaviour that needs to be called out. And then there are so many men who are just scared, they\u2019re just waiting for the phone to ring, they\u2019re waiting to open their computer and see their faces and it\u2019s a frightening time for them. But then we\u2019re going, \u2018We\u2019ve been frightened our whole lives.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Show of strength: on the Women\u2019s March in 2017 with Madonna.

It\u2019s a subject even closer to her heart after two young women were shot in an American cinema while watching her movie Trainwreck. The day we meet, schoolkids are pouring out of their classrooms across the USA to demonstrate, \u201cand I think once I start looking at that news footage I\u2019ll just be crying all day,\u201d she says. We discuss the Florida survivors, such as Emma Gonzalez. \u201cThese kids are really making an impact and I feel more hopeful right now than I thought possible,\u201d she says. \u201cThis has been more movement than I thought that I would see in my lifetime. I think what they\u2019re just realising is that the adults are not actually in control.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also time for a change in Schumer\u2019s own life. I ask about a typical day for her and she says that for the past 10 years, from the moment she woke up till she went to sleep, \u201cI was driven and working and writing. Doing stand-up, you know, promoting something or filming something. I would say that, for 15 years, I was getting up at seven, going boxing, showering, going to the writer\u2019s room all day, and having an interview during lunch. Afterward, maybe getting some sort of acupuncture before going and doing stand-up, and then having, like, 90 minutes when I could write when I got home. You know? That\u2019s been it. I\u2019ve been hustling for so long, I want to take care of myself now. I got really sick and it just made me realise I wasn\u2019t invincible. I need to slow down.\u201d\n\nOne last thing though \u2013 can we just clear up the one-night-stand thing? Do you really mean you only had sex within relationships? \u201cNo! See to me, a one-night stand is where you meet someone that same day, you have sex with them, and then you never see them again. Sleeping with a friend or having sex with someone you know just once, no, I don\u2019t consider that a one-night stand. I should make an addendum to that book. Something else I realised: I wrote that I don\u2019t like watercress in the book. But I meant water chestnuts. So I need to publish two corrections, I guess.\u201d\n\nI Feel Pretty is in cinemas in the UK and Ireland on 4 May","12":"Fifty years ago civil rights activists took to the streets of Derry, Belfast and Armagh. Their bid to effect peaceful change is arguably one of the great \u2018what if?\u2019 moments in Irish history, now remembered in a new exhibtion\n\nWhen did the Troubles begin? Was it when the first stone was thrown or the first shot fired? Or did they begin earlier with a police baton blow? Or earlier still with a peaceful march demanding civil rights? As with almost anything to do with Northern Ireland\u2019s turbulent political past, the moment is contested. For me, they began on 30 November 1968, when, as a young lad, I attended a civil rights march in my home town, Armagh.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (Nicra) had been formed the year before by a broad coalition \u2013 trade unionists, radical socialists, republicans and members of the Northern Irish Labour and Liberal parties \u2013 with the same basic aim: to challenge anti-Catholic discrimination in jobs and housing. One of its defining slogans was the now quaintly sexist \u201cOne man, one vote\u201d, which demanded an end to the system of plural voting that prevailed in Northern Ireland long after it had been abolished in the rest of the UK. To be eligible to vote in a local election in Northern Ireland you had to be a homeowner, most of whom were middle- and upper-class Protestants. Many of them were business owners, which entitled them to several extra votes.\n\nTo make matters worse, the state also employed gerrymandering (manipulating ward boundaries in local elections to maintain a false unionist majority). This meant that in 1968 in predominantly Catholic Derry, where the total nationalist vote was 14,000 and the unionist vote 9,000, the local council comprised 12 unionist and eight nationalist members. Since its inception in 1921, when Ireland was partitioned, Northern Ireland, though remaining part of the UK, was a place apart. One of its founders, Lord Craigavon, had promised \u201ca Protestant parliament for a Protestant people\u201d. Four decades later, the state was essentially and unapologetically biased in favour of its majority population in terms of the allocation of council houses and jobs.\n\nWhen we saw police laying into marchers, it was as if something hidden and hateful had been pushed into the open Rory McShane, civil rights activist\n\nFor the majority of working-class Catholics who took to the streets in support of civil rights, the cause was personal as well as political. After they married, my parents were on a council house waiting list for 13 years, living for most of that time with my maternal grandparents. For that period and longer, neither of them had a vote in a local election. As with many of their generation, the civil rights protests signalled to them an end to the soul-sapping collective acquiescence that had prevailed in the province for so long, and led to an embrace of a late-flowering activism that was profoundly empowering.\n\nI remember the day of the Armagh march well: the almost carnival atmosphere as the marchers, several thousand strong, set off from the Killylea Road, close to the housing estate I lived on. My parents joined the march, taking my younger brother and sister with them. My grandparents attended, as did most of my relatives and several of my school teachers and fellow pupils from the Christian Brothers\u2019 grammar school. Almost everyone from Catholic housing estates in the town seemed to be there, as well as many prominent middle-class local figures. Protesters came from all over the north, and even from the south. Under the civil rights banner, trade unionists, Labour party members, radical socialists, communists and even anarchists united for a common cause, with ordinary, politically unaffiliated people believing, perhaps for the first time in their lives, that real change was a possibility.\n\nAll this came back to me a few months ago when I was asked by the Gallery of Photography Ireland to put forward an idea for an exhibition. The more I thought about it, the more it seemed crucial to evoke the sense of excitement and empowerment of that lost moment in 1968, before the Troubles reinstated an older narrative of violent Irish republicanism against British colonialism.\n\nFor many people, particularly in England, the Troubles are understood essentially as a war between the IRA, whose aim was to reunite Ireland, and the British security forces. The short-lived civil rights era of the late 60s and early 70s has been conveniently overlooked, perhaps because it illuminates the fact that the endemic discrimination in Northern Ireland was ignored for decades by successive Westminster governments of every political hue. In retrospect, though, it represents one of the great \u201cwhat if?\u201d moments when the violence that followed might have been averted through reform.\n\nI have called the exhibition The Lost Moment (having decided after much deliberation not to place a question mark after the title) and it will open on 28 April in the Nerve Centre in Derry, a gallery housed in the former Ebrington army barracks that looked over the city throughout the Troubles. The show will include work by local and international photographers as well as films, projections and ephemera from the time in the form of political posters, periodicals and pamphlets. It is an attempt to evoke not just the spirit of idealism and protest, but also the anxieties and anger of the unionist counter-demonstrations that sprang up in reaction to it.\n\nOne of the aims of the exhibition is to place the Northern Irish civil rights movement in the context of other protest movements of the time. It was a struggle that adopted the nonviolent tactics espoused by Martin Luther King and his followers in America \u2013 even borrowing their gospel anthem, We Shall Overcome. Like that movement, it was a broad church \u2013 an approach with which its more radical supporters, particularly the young leftwing students who formed the more militant People\u2019s Democracy party in 1968, quickly grew impatient. They looked instead towards the more confrontational actions on the streets of Paris and Chicago during the various revolutionary uprisings of that tumultuous year. Veteran Derry-based leftwing activist and political commentator Eamonn McCann, for instance, had attended the anti-Vietnam war protest in London\u2019s Grosvenor Square in March of that year, which ended in a riot.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The first civil rights march, on 24 August 1968 in Dungannon. Photograph: Belfast Telegraph\n\nHistorian Paul Bew, one of several Protestant leftwing student activists at the time (and later an adviser to the former unionist leader David Trimble) says: \u201cI don\u2019t recall ever having a discussion about the border or the national question with any of the student protest leaders. It was all about Vietnam, Prague, Paris \u2013 those issues cut across the partisan politics of Northern Ireland and fed into the protests there.\u201d One of the student leaders, Michael Farrell, later recalled how a group of activists went straight from an anti-Vietnam war protest outside Belfast city hall to the first civil rights march in Dungannon in August 1968, replacing the slogans on their placards along the way.\n\nThe march from Coalisland to Dungannon on Saturday 24 August 1968 drew 4,000 people, and despite a government ban and a vociferous loyalist counter-demonstration organised by the Rev Ian Paisley, passed off peacefully. McCann and his fellow activists immediately contacted Nicra with a request to hold another march in Derry on Saturday 5 October. At the 11th hour, it was banned by William Craig, the minister for home affairs, after a local loyalist organisation announced that they would hold a march along the same route on the same day.\n\nThe Derry activists decided to go ahead with the protest anyway, hoping their defiance would help attract an even bigger crowd. The ban had the opposite effect and only about 400 assembled at the start point, with another 200 curious onlookers lining the pavements. \u201cIt was a very disappointing crowd,\u201d McCann later concluded. What subsequently happened, though, had a seismic impact way beyond Derry and Northern Ireland.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A poster announcing the Derry march that ended in disaster. Photograph: Nicra \/ Museum of Free Derry\n\nThe march ended almost before it began, when large numbers of Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) employed a tactic that decades later would be known as \u201ckettling\u201d \u2013 hemming in the protesters on Duke Street. Stewards urged the crowd to keep calm, but placards were thrown in frustration. Then all hell broke lose. Gaye O\u2019Brien, a news cameraman from the Irish broadcaster RTE, was on hand to record the RUC\u2019s response. The footage remains viscerally shocking to this day \u2013 baton-wielding officers wading into the crowd, felling young and old alike, cracking skulls as women scream and children scatter. An unsuspecting elderly man is struck from behind across the side of the face. Moments later, a breathless officer batons a marcher to the ground, his face twisted in fury, before he catches sight of the camera that has just captured his violence for posterity.\n\nAmong those who escaped serious injury that day, but underwent a dramatic political epiphany, was a young woman who would soon become one of the key figures in the years of ferment that were to follow. \u201cYou could feel the hatred,\u201d Bernadette Devlin said decades later. \u201cThat\u2019s my recollection of that day. It was my first realisation that the police hated us.\u201d\n\nAcross the nationalist areas of the north, the scenes of police violence provoked a collective howl of anger. \u201cPeople were outraged,\u201d remembers Rory McShane, who in 1968 was president of the students\u2019 union at Queen\u2019s University in Belfast and a prominent civil rights activist. \u201cWhen we saw the police laying into the marchers on the news, it was as if something hidden and hateful had suddenly been pushed out into the open.\u201d\n\nCoverage of the violence achieved more in terms of highlighting the plight of Northern Ireland\u2019s Catholic minority than decades of dogged, but unproductive, campaigning by nationalist politicians. Derry suddenly became synonymous with Selma and the US black civil rights struggle led by the recently murdered Martin Luther King. If, as Devlin later put it, \u201ctelevision brought the world to our doorstep\u201d, it also brought the civil rights cause in Northern Ireland to a global audience. \u201cThe Bogside was deluged with journalists,\u201d recalled McCann. \u201cA journalist from the Daily Mail came to my front door asking for the name and address of an articulate, Catholic, unemployed slum-dweller she could talk to. Derry was big news.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Belfast Telegraph, from November 1968, reports on the violence spiralling out from the Derry march. Photograph: The Belfast Telegraph\n\nThe immediate effect was about 2,000 students organised a march from the university to the city hall in protest at police brutality. They were blocked by the RUC and another counter-demonstration organised by Paisley, who was fast become an imposing and divisive presence in Northern Irish politics. A four-hour sit-down protest ensued.\n\nIt was against this backdrop of protest and counter-protest that the march in Armagh took place. I went to the assembly point early with a couple of friends and we attached ourselves to a group containing some older lads from school. They had congregated beneath a large red-and-black banner, which we soon discovered belonged to a small, but vociferous, local anarchist group. Ahead of them was a much bigger group of young radicals who belonged to the People\u2019s Democracy party. They exuded a collective confidence that was in contrast to the more tentative demeanor of some of the older people there. As we set off towards the centre of town, the crowd sang We Shall Overcome. It is my recollection that the anarchists and student radicals didn\u2019t join in, instead chanting \u201cHo Ho Ho Chi Minh! \u2013 We shall fight and we shall win!\u201d and \u201cTwo, four, six, eight \u2013 organise and smash the state!\u201d It was all very new and exciting, an event of almost epic proportions for those of us who had never witnessed such an energising disruption of the everyday.\n\nOn we went, singing and chanting, until the march came to an abrupt halt. In the ensuing confusion, my friends and I negotiated our way through the throng to the corner of Thomas Street, which led to the town centre. A line of uneasy-looking RUC men stood in front of their vehicles, which blocked the street. Beyond them, at the other end of the street, another row of police was visible, and behind them a huge crowd of union jack-waving loyalists. They were \u201cthe Paisleyites\u201d and they had somehow been allowed to commandeer the centre of town. The protesters were outraged, but the presence of the Paisleyites was not entirely unexpected: rumours had circulated though the Catholic housing estates earlier that a certain Protestant shopkeeper had been seen handing out pickaxe handles to a mob that had arrived in town the night before. There were indeed large sticks being brandished in Market Street alongside the union flags being waved.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Armagh march on 30 November 1968. Photograph: Ulster Gazette\n\nAnother rumour quickly spread through the marchers that some in the loyalist mob were armed. The tone of the march changed quickly from celebratory to defiant. An RUC man addressed the crowd who, surprisingly, listened attentively. He assured us that we were not allowed to proceed for our own security, which elicited hoots of jeering laughter. Prominent civil rights figures Ivan Cooper and John Hume cautioned restraint through a crackling megaphone. Their pleas were successful and, after some debate and a few attempts by one boy to scale the police barricade, the marchers turned back, much to the disgust of the young militants.\n\nLater that day, police attacked a crowd of locals who had broken the windows of a departing bus full of Paisleyites. \u201cI vividly remember the RUC arrived and the stewards tried to negotiate with them,\u201d recalls Dermot Kelly, who attended the march as a young People\u2019s Democracy activist. \u201cIt seemed to work, but then the RUC broke though their ranks and started batoning everyone in sight, including the moderators. It was vicious and indiscriminate.\u201d A familiar narrative was being played out: loyalist triumphalism, aggressive policing of the protests, rising frustration among the protesters.\n\nFor days afterwards, the question asked by the nationalist community in Armagh was: what would have happened if a nationalist mob had attempted to take control of the town centre to prevent a loyalist march? It was, of course, a rhetorical question: everyone knew the answer. It was clear too, that a sizable minority of the protesters were growing impatient with the perceived compliance of the civil rights association in the face of the police and loyalist tactics. Where I lived, the middle-class representatives of Nicra were now being referred to derisively as \u201cgreen Tories\u201d.\n\nWhat happened next, as 1968 gave way to 1969, and the schism between the moderates and the militants in the civil rights movement deepened, is viewed by some historians, including Paul Bew, as one of the crucial moments in the escalating drama that preceded the coming years of violence. On Monday 9 December 1968, the Northern Ireland prime minister, Terence O\u2019Neill, made a television appeal to moderates of every political persuasion in what became known as his \u201cUlster stands at the crossroads\u201d speech. It could be said, with hindsight, that the patrician and undoubtedly sincere O\u2019Neill fundamentally misunderstood the depth of feeling on both sides, most crucially among the more hardline unionist forces that would soon topple him.\n\nWhy put the Good Friday agreement at risk when harmony is possible? | Letters Read more\n\nBew sees it differently. \u201cOne could view the events of early 1969 as the real lost moment,\u201d he says. \u201cO\u2019Neill had come up with a modest reform programme that many on the unionist side, as well as the Catholic middle class and the church, had accepted as a step forward and a meaningful commitment to further change. Our march shattered the prospects of that change taking place.\u201d\n\nThe march Bew refers to was organised by the People\u2019s Democracy party, of which he was then a member, against the advice of the civil rights association, who thought its route too provocative. Modelled directly on Martin Luther King\u2019s Selma to Montgomery march from 1965, it began in Belfast on New Year\u2019s Day, 1969, and ended four days later in Derry, its route taking the marchers through several rural Protestant areas along the way. For Michael Farrell and the party\u2019s other young socialists it was a way of keeping the momentum of protest going in the face of reforms that they, like many in the nationalist community, thought of as too little too late.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In April 1969 21-year-old Bernadette Devlin became Britain\u2019s youngest ever female MP, winning south Derry for the People\u2019s Democracy party. Photograph: PA Archive\/PA Images\n\nAbout 40 student protesters left Belfast, growing to about 200 over the following days. They were attacked by stone-throwing loyalists on several occasions, but nothing prepared them for what happened as they crossed Burntollet Bridge on the fourth day. Waiting in ambush was a crowd of about 200 loyalists, including off-duty members of the \u201cB-Specials\u201d (an all-Protestant auxiliary police force), who descended on the marchers with sticks, iron bars, bottles and stones. Panic ensued with protesters, including several injured women, running into the river and the nearby fields. Though 80 RUC officers had accompanied the march, they seemed unable or unwilling to provide protection. The Burntollet ambush, shown on television that evening, was etched on the nationalist psyche as another example of state collusion with loyalist mob rule. \u201cNo one did as much damage to the unionist cause as the people who attacked the marchers at Burntollet,\u201d says Bew.\n\nIn the months after, events in Northern Ireland accelerated. In early February, O\u2019Neill announced the dissolution of Stormont and a subsequent election that would signal a major schism in the unionist party. On 17 April 1969, Bernadette Devlin stood as an independent Unity candidate in Mid Ulster. Aged 21, she became the youngest woman to be elected as an MP at Westminster and made her debut with one of the most stirring speeches ever made in the House.\n\nA few days later, serious rioting broke out in Derry after clashes between civil rights protesters and loyalists, who laid siege to the nationalist Bogside area. The following month, what came to be known as the Battle of the Bogside took place when RUC officers and loyalists once again attempted to enter the area. They were met with fierce resistance from locals, many of whom had been present when the police attacked the civil rights march on Duke Street less than a year before. As Bogside residents forced the RUC out of the area and declared it Free Derry, rioting spread across Northern Ireland. The most vicious outbreak of sectarian violence erupted in Belfast, where hundreds of families were driven from their burning homes by a large loyalist mob, an event that directly led to the IRA re-forming and recruiting younger volunteers in nationalist areas. In Divis flats, a nine-year-old boy, Patrick Rooney, became the first child victim of the trouble, killed by RUC machine-gun fire as he lay sleeping. On Thursday 14 August 1969, British troops were deployed on the streets of Northern Ireland. The darkness had descended with a vengeance.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Derry youths throw petrol bombs at the RUC during the Battle of the Bogside in August 1969. Photograph: Peter Ferraz\/Getty Images\n\nThat same evening, in Armagh, a local man called John Gallagher was shot dead by members of the B-Specials on the Cathedral Road. He was the first of eight people to die by violence that month, five of them killed by security forces. Gallagher had unwittingly walked into a street disturbance that followed the cancellation of a civil rights meeting in Armagh city hall due to the escalating tension. I remember the utter bewilderment felt by many in the town when news of his death spread. Already, the carnival atmosphere that had prevailed on the day of the civil rights march just nine months previously had become a distant memory.\n\nThere are those that still maintain that the people who took to the streets in peaceful protest share the blame for starting the Troubles. I, as you might have guessed, am not one of them. I leave the last word to someone from my home town who also marched on that day. \u201cIt seems to me now that we were idealistic to the point of naive in underestimating how violent the state\u2019s response would be,\u201d says Dermot Kelly. \u201cBut looking back, we were very clear in our aims. People have the right to aspire to equality in a democracy. You either believe that or you don\u2019t. And, if you do, then marching for the rights denied you by a so-called democracy seems a perfectly reasonable thing to do.\u201d\n\nThe Lost Moment exhibtion opens at the Nerve Centre, Derry on 28 April","13":"A woman cries at a hospital after she lost her son in a suicide attack on a voter registration center in Kabul, Afghanistan, Sunday, April 22, 2018.

Eric Greitens speaks to supporters during a rally Tuesday, May 23, 2017, outside the state Capitol in Jefferson City, Mo. Greitens has brought lawmakers back to for a special session to consider legislation that would allow steel-works facilities and aluminum smelters to negotiate electricity rates lower than what is allowed under current law and for longer contracts which supporters say would create jobs while critics call the push a veiled attempt to make it easier for investor-owned utilities companies to raise rates. Jeff Roberson\/AP\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) \u2014 St. Louis prosecutors on Friday charged Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens with a felony for using a charity donor list for his 2016 political campaign, adding to the woes of the first-term governor who responded by calling it another effort to \"smear\" him.\n\nThe charge of tampering with computer data is in addition to an earlier charge alleging Greitens took and transmitted a nonconsensual photo of a partially nude woman with whom he had an extramarital affair in 2015. The new charge accuses Greitens of disclosing the donor list from The Mission Continues in 2015 without permission from the St. Louis-based charity that Greitens founded.\n\nThe Associated Press first reported in October 2016 that Greitens' campaign obtained a list of top donors to The Mission Continues and raised nearly $2 million from donors who were on it.\n\nGreitens has been facing increasing pressure to resign \u2014 including from fellow Republicans \u2014 since a special House investigative committee's report released April 11 that detailed allegations from the woman with whom he had the affair. She testified that Greitens restrained, slapped, grabbed, shoved and threatened her during a series of sexual encounters that at times left her crying and afraid.\n\nGreitens has denied committing any crimes and vowed to remain in office, calling the investigations into him a \"political witch hunt.\" On Friday, he accused Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, a Democrat, of wasting \"thousands and thousands of taxpayer dollars.\"\n\n\"Her original case is falling apart \u2014 so today, she's brought a new one,\" Greitens said in a statement. \"By now, everyone knows what this is: this prosecutor will use any charge she can to smear me.\"\n\nMissouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican whose office has been investigating The Mission Continues, announced Tuesday that he had found evidence to support a felony charge against Greitens, but said it was up to the St. Louis circuit attorney's office to file charges. That office had to move quickly because the statute of limitations was approaching.\n\nA probable cause statement says Greitens directed a person identified as K.T. to disclose the charity's donor list to a political fundraiser on April 22, 2015. It doesn't identify the fundraiser. The initials match those of Krystal Taylor, an employee of the Greitens Group who had previously worked at The Mission Continues.\n\nThe court filing says Greitens and K.T. knew the charity donor list had been taken without the permission of the charity and used without its consent. Federal law generally prohibits charities such as The Mission Continues from becoming involved in political campaigns, and the charity has repeatedly denied granting permission for Greitens \u2014 its former CEO \u2014 to use the list for political purposes.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Gail McCann Beatty cited the new charge as additional grounds for lawmakers to try to quickly remove Greitens from office.\n\n\"One way or another, Eric Greitens' short tenure as Missouri governor is about to end. The only person who doesn't understand that is Eric Greitens,\" Beatty said. \"Since he will not resign, the House of Representatives must immediately begin impeachment proceedings.\"\n\nHawley's office has said that its investigation into The Mission Continues began after the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in February that it had it had obtained a copy of an email indicating that Taylor had shared the charity donor list in January 2015 with Michael Hafner, who had been working for Greitens' gubernatorial exploratory committee, and Danny Laub, Greitens' first campaign manager. But that incident wasn't cited in the criminal charge, because it was past the three-year statute of limitations.\n\nWhen the AP first reported about the campaigns' access to the charity donor list in 2015, Greitens initially denied to the AP that he had used the donor list for his campaign. But in April 2017, Greitens agreed to pay a $100 fine for failing to report that his gubernatorial campaign had, in fact, received the charity's donor list. Greitens' campaign filed amended finance reports referring to the list as an in-kind contribution valued at $600 and received March 1, 2015, from Laub.\n\nGreitens' attorney, Edward L. Dowd Jr., said the new charge \"makes no sense at all,\" noting that it was Greitens who built the charity and raised millions of dollars for it through \"an extraordinary act of public service.\"\n\n\"Now he's being accused of stealing an email list from an organization he built? Give me a break,\" Dowd said in a statement. \"Not only did he create this list donor by donor, friend by friend, but the Mission Continues still has the list.\"\n\nThe charge intensifies the feud between Greitens and Gardner. He has called her a \"reckless liberal prosecutor\" for leading the investigation that resulted in the invasion-of-privacy charge. His attorneys, in court hearings and filings, have painted a picture of an incompetent prosecutor who rather than working with police to investigate Greitens hired a private investigator who bungled the investigation, hid evidence and lied to the court.\n\nGardner's office began investigating after KMOV-TV in St. Louis first reported on the affair on Jan. 10, the day Greitens was giving his annual State of the State speech. The governor acknowledged the affair but denied allegations that he had threatened to release a compromising photo of the woman if she disclosed the relationship. His trial in that case is scheduled to begin May 14.\n\nGreitens, a former Navy SEAL officer and Rhodes Scholar, and Hawley both won election in 2016 as maverick political outsiders. Hawley is now running to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, and Democrats have been running TV ads linking Hawley to Greitens. Democrats have criticized Hawley's earlier investigation that found no wrongdoing in Greitens' use of a text message-destroying app, and claimed he stepped up his investigation of the charity only after it became politically beneficial.\n\nIn the Legislature, meanwhile, Senate leaders are considering holding off on sending bills to Greitens amid the multiple investigations. Republican Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard and Democratic Minority Floor Leader Gina Walsh have not made a final decision, but Walsh has said she doesn't believe any bills signed by Greitens should become law.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter David A.

The Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray will protect your hair from heat damage without weighing it down, keep frizz at bay, and give you silky hair at an extremely affordable price. If you use any type of heat styling tool on your hair \u2014 whether it\u2019s a hair dryer, curling iron, or hair straightener \u2014 a heat protectant is a must-have! Exposing your hair to any type of heat without applying a protectant first is like laying out in the sun without any sunscreen. It may not be super noticeable at first, but the consequences won\u2019t be pretty. Without a properly applied protectant, heat will dry out your hair, making it brittle and prone to breakage. To find the heat protectant that's best suited to your hair type, there are a few things you should consider. The most important factor is your hair type. You may find that one kind of protectant works better for you than another. If you have fine or frizz-prone hair, you\u2019ll want a protectant that will smooth flyaways without weighing down your strands. If you have hair that is already prone to damage, look for a protectant that provides maximum protection of up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. If you have thick hair, a protectant that can be applied to wet hair is ideal so all that volume can soak up the product. Knowing how you want to style your hair can also help you decide which heat protectant will best serve you. Heat protection should be applied at the very beginning of your styling routine. If you just plan on blow drying your hair, a conditioning protection mist may be all you need. If you plan on using a hair straightener, using a protectant that will help smooth your hair and create shine will make styling easier. For a wavy or curly style, a protectant that provides texture, volume, and hold can help you achieve curls that won\u2019t go limp after a couple of hours.

While it\u2019s an excellent heat protectant, be aware that this formula doesn\u2019t provide any hold, so if you are curling your hair, you\u2019ll want to layer it with another product. Since it has a lightweight formula, it can be layered with other products without your hair feeling greasy or weighed down. Experts agree. In its review, Allure praises this Tresemme heat protectant for being \u201clight as a feather\u201d on hair, and for the spray gun style nozzle that \u201ccovers hair quickly and evenly.\u201d As with any hair product, for the best results, you\u2019ll need to follow the instructions on the packaging. For this heat protectant, it\u2019s advised to spray 6 to 8 inches away from your head, from mid-shaft to the ends of your hair. For the most thorough heat protection, you should use on your hair while its wet, before drying, and then again if you\u2019re using additional heat styling tools once it\u2019s dry.

The HSI Professional Heat Protector is infused with antioxidant-rich argan oil to make your hair sleek and shiny. Most importantly, it creates a protective barrier against heat styling tools. If you blow dry and straighten your hair often, this heat protectant will help keep your hair healthy. Even if you aren\u2019t using heat styling tools every day, this heat protectant can also work as a leave-in conditioner to create a frizz-free look. It\u2019s sulfate, paraben, and phosphate free so it can also be used on color treated hair and even human hair extensions. While the HSI Professional Heat Protector can work with any heat styling tool to protect your hair, its high heat protection and infusion of argan oil make it ideal if you want to straighten your hair \u2014 especially if it\u2019s naturally very curly. The argan oil will smooth and get rid of frizz, while the heat protection of up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit will allow you to use higher heat settings if needed. You may equate anything with oil in it to be heavy, but this heat protectant still manages to have a weightless feel while protecting your hair and infusing it with moisture. This makes it ideal for straightening both fine and thick hair. It can be applied to wet or dry hair for styling. If you are starting with wet hair, you should apply before using a blow dryer to provide full coverage against heat damage. Some reviewers did find the smell of this hair protectant too strong. On the upside, those that found the scent to be strong do note that the product itself does work well. Other reviewers are complete converts, loving the way their hair looks, feels, and smells after using it. Reviewer Karina loves that it \u201cgets all those stubborn little hairs in place\u201d and \u201cmakes the straightening job much easier.\u201d Pros: Heat resistant up to 450 degrees, infused with argan oil for a sleek look and frizz control, weightless feel, can be used on wet and dry hair Cons: Some reviewers didn\u2019t like the scent Buy the HSI Professional Argan Oil Heat Protector on Amazon for $6.95 to $14.99\n\nThe best heat protectant for curling Why you'll love it: The Matrix Biolage Thermal Active Setting Spray provides heat protection as well as light hold for long-lasting curls and waves that won\u2019t feel stiff or crunchy. Hair products that serve a dual purpose make for a great addition to your style routine, saving you time and money. If you curl your hair often, a heat protectant that provides both protection against heat and hold to keep your style in place is definitely worth considering. The Matrix Thermal Active Setting Spray does both, and won\u2019t leave your hair feeling stiff or crunchy like some hairsprays tend to do. It will also add volume and shine, so your hairstyle won\u2019t go limp and dull halfway through the day. It\u2019s happened to the best of us, but getting up early to style your hair is a wasted effort if your style doesn\u2019t last. This is a non-aerosol spray that can be applied to both wet and dry hair. You can apply a layer before blow drying for thermal protection. Then, apply another layer to hair once it\u2019s dry before you start using any other heat styling tools to provide extra hold. If you have fine, naturally straight hair that typically doesn\u2019t hold curl very well, you're in luck with this spray. Reviewer Meagan says this is \u201cthe only product that works on my straight hair to hold curl. It doesn\u2019t leave sticky residue like other products I\u2019ve tried.\u201d In addition to providing hold, volume, and shine this protectant will also help control frizz and flyaways. While it works great with curling irons and hot curlers, it can also be used with a hair straightener or just a blow dryer for a frizz-free style that stays in place and has extra shine. Some reviewers did experience stickiness after using this product and felt that it coated their hair too heavily. As with most hair products, hair type and user application do influence the effectiveness of a heat protectant. With hair products that provide any sort of hold, it\u2019s important to remember that a little goes a long way. Start with the minimal amount of product, and only add more as needed, otherwise, you can easily end up with stiff, greasy feeling hair. Most reviewers are happy they tried the Matrix Biolage Thermal Active Setting Spray, loving that it helps fine hair hold curl, keeps frizz at bay, and that their hair stays in place without feeling too heavy. Pros: Provides soft hold for curly and wavy hairstyles, adds volume and shine, can be used on wet or dry hair Cons: Some reviewers experienced stickiness after using it, and felt the formula was too heavy Buy the Matrix Biolage Thermal Active Setting Spray on Amazon for $13.58\n\nThe best heat protectant for fine hair Why you'll love it: The Kenra Thermal Styling Spray 19 provides thermal protection up to 428 degrees, will tame frizz and flyaways, and has a truly weightless formula ideal for fine hair. It can be easy for fine hair to get weighed down with product, becoming greasy and limp. While this may deter you from wanting to put a heat protectant in your hair and start styling right away, you should really use one. Fine hair can also be easily damaged and is prone to breakage, so if you\u2019re using heat styling tools without any protectant, you\u2019ll be putting your hair at risk. Luckily, there are hair products designed for fine hair, like the Kenra Thermal Styling Spray. The non-sticking formula will protect your hair from heat, but won\u2019t leave any residue behind. It provides a clean and easy release from curling irons and hair straighteners that will minimize breakage. It\u2019s weightless, but does provide just enough control to tame any frizz or flyaways, and will add shine to any hairstyle. This spray also provides light hold for use with curling irons and hair straighteners alike, giving your curls bounce, or keeping your hair pin straight all day depending on which style you decide to go with. This is a styling spray, so it\u2019s meant to be applied to dry hair right before using a curling iron or hair straightener. If you\u2019re starting with wet hair, you\u2019ll want to apply a heat protectant designed to be used before blow drying. If you\u2019re worried about layering products, the lightweight formula of the Kenra Thermal Styling Spray will allow it to be used with other products. As with any heat protectant, it\u2019s important to follow the instructions on the packaging for the best results. When using this spray, you can apply it to hair section by section as you apply your styling tool. When you\u2019re done styling, it\u2019s also advised to spray over your entire head 8 to 10 inches away for a finishing hold. Some buyers did find the formula to be too sticky for their hair, and others felt that it dried out their hair over time. However, most fine-haired reviewers love this spray and found that it worked well enough to use daily to prevent heat damage and provide hold when they wanted to straighten or curl their hair. Reviewer Aimee from ultabeauty.com says, \u201cI have been using this product for years. For my super fine straight hair, I get the longest lasting curls I have ever had.\u201d Reviewer Cindy Lou echoes this sentiment, saying, \u201cI love the hold this gives my hair!

Courtesy of Harold Rocketto\n\nLike any dad, he wanted to share his passion with his children. But since his sport came with a certain stigma, he made sure my sister and I were well-versed in gun safety. He never left his rifles out in the open, and immediately stored them in their safe when he returned home from a match. He constantly reminded us that he did not use his rifles on people or animals, and never would. Heck, we weren't allowed to watch \"Bambi\" as kids because he didn't want us to associate him with the death of an adorable creature.\n\nBecause of my upbringing, my mind goes to a million places when I see a story about gun violence or gun regulations in the news. That was the case this weekend when former NFL player and CBS sports announcer Jay Feely shared a photo on Twitter that featured himself holding a handgun alongside his daughter and her prom date, as INSIDER previously reported.\n\nFeely captioned the photo, \"wishing my beautiful daughter and her date a great time at prom\" with the hashtag #BadBoys. More than 12,000 people responded to the original Tweet at the time of publication. While there were some shows of support for Feely, the majority of the messages chastised the former Miami Dolphins player for the image.\n\nMany were quick to point out the timing of Feely's tweet, which came two months after the shooting Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a month after the March For Our Lives protests for stricter gun control, and the same week as the 19th anniversary of the infamous Columbine school shooting.\n\nOthers were frustrated by the message behind Feely's photo. To many, this photo promotes the idea that women, particularly young ones, are incapable of making decisions that won't lead to trouble; that they can't defend themselves and need a man to do it for them \u2014 bonus points if it's done with violence.\n\nFeely did not respond to INSIDER's request for comment at the time of publication. He did, however, respond to the criticisms of his photo on Twitter.\n\n\"The prom picture I posted was obviously intended to be a joke. My Daughter has dated her boyfriend for over a year and they knew I was joking,\" Feely wrote, adding that he takes gun safety seriously.\n\nBut as stories of the photo showed up in my Twitter feed, I couldn't help but think about my own dad who, like Feely, owns a gun. Despite being my protector, he never used his gun ownership or skills as a way to threaten gun use against me or my boyfriends \u2014 even as a joke. Even when an ex-boyfriend stalked me for a year and threatened my safety, my dad did not make a joke about having \"a gun, a shovel, and an alibi\" nor did he threaten this guy's safety with one of his many rifles. He simply asked how he could help me.\n\nMy dad, like many gun owners, is aware of the dangers guns can have when put in the wrong hands. He knows that roughly 96 Americans are killed by guns each day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He knows that, as cited by Every Town, 50 American women are shot to death by intimate partners each month. He knows that nearly 1,300 children die from gunshot wounds each year, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. And because he knows all this, he knows not to make jokes about gun violence.\n\nAnd if he ever tried, he knows I have the self-agency to tell him off.\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.","17":"CLOSE Police released the 911 call that led to Travis Reinking's arrest 34 hours after authorities say he killed four people in a shooting at an Antioch Waffle House.\n\nBuy Photo Law enforcement personnel escort accused Antioch Waffle House gunman Travis Reinking into booking Monday, April 23, 3018, at Hill Detention Center in Nashville, Tenn.

Family members said he had threatened to kill himself and told police he \"owns and had access to many firearms at his residence.\" His parents told police Reinking had been having similar delusions since 2014.\n\nReinking, who was 27 at the time, was taken to a local hospital for a mental health evaluation. It's unknown what the evaluation found or when he was released.\n\nBetween August 2016 and March 2017, Reinking had moved to the small town of Salida, Colorado. At the crane company where he worked, his bosses and a coworker said he exhibited bizarre behaviors, including an \"obsession\" with Taylor Swift whom he claimed he would marry, but he also complained Swift was stalking and harassing him, and hacking his bank accounts, according to a Salida police report.\n\nReinking claimed he was a \"sovereign citizen\" - a group the FBI defines as anti-government extremists who believe they are separate or \u201csovereign\u201d from the United States. He showed a coworker his guns.\n\nWhen he quit. claiming police were following him, he said he was moving back to Illinois. His former boss in Colorado, Ken Sustrich called his father \"to let him know of concerns he had about Travis' mental health issues.\"\n\nIn June, 2017, Illinois police intervened again. Reinking had threatened an employee of his father's crane company while holding an AR-15 rifle and wearing a pink dress.\n\nLater the same day, he drove to a public pool, took off the pink dress and jumped in, exposing himself and yelling at those present.\n\nMore: Waffle House shooting suspect Travis Reinking's $2 million bond revoked; new charges added\n\nMore: Waffle House hero: Could you rush toward a gunman who just killed people?\n\nIn a report about that incident, police said: \"Travis has some mental problems.\" They searched him for weapons but found none.\n\nPolice contacted Jeff Reinking, Travis' father, who said he had taken three rifles and a hand gun away from his son and locked them up \u2013 but had recently returned them.\n\nMore: Police search Travis Reinking's electronics amid investigation into Waffle House shooting\n\nMore: Sheriff Daron Hall explains how the jail is securing the Waffle House shooting suspect\n\nOne month later, in July 2017, U.S. Secret Service arrested Reinking for being in a \"restricted area\" near the White House. Reinking said he wanted to meet with the president.\n\nThen in early August, 2017, an Illinois police officer encountered Reinking again. Reinking reported that people were tapping into his phone and computer, and that \"unknown people outside his residence barking like dogs.\"\n\nThe officer filed a report, noting \"this is an informational report only. No further action is being taken.\"\n\nLater that month, in connection to the Secret Service arrest, his Illinois firearms authorization was revoked. Local Illinois authorities seized four weapons and placed them with Jeff Reinking. His father later admitted giving the weapons back to his son, but it is unclear when that happened.\n\nEight months later, Reinking made national headlines when he allegedly killed four people and injured several others in a Nashville Waffle House, spurring a 34-hour manhunt until police apprehended him on Monday. Reinking has been charged with four counts of criminal homicide. He remains jailed without bond.\n\nReinking's brushes with the law reveal a pattern of mental instability that raised red flags among local and federal officials \u2013 but they also reveal the limits of law enforcement in removing guns from people whose mental illnesses could pose a risk of danger to the public, experts said.\n\n\"If a police officer is concerned somebody shouldn't have a gun, there's very little an officer can do,\" said Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for stricter gun regulations.\n\nThere is also little that can prevent gun buyers with mental illness from purchasing weapons.\n\nSince 1968, a federal law has barred the possession or acquisition of firearms by anyone who \u201chas been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution.\"\n\nFrom 1998 to 2014, the FBI rejected 16,669 potential gun buyers because a background check found a mental health adjudication, about 1.4 percent of the roughly 1.2 million background checks that resulted in a denial.\n\nThe National Rifle Association has urged policymakers to focus on the nation's mental health system without limiting gun rights. They also have stressed that there are protections in place.\n\n\"The NRA will support any reasonable step to fix America\u2019s broken mental health system without intruding on the constitutional rights of Americans,\" according to a statement posted on the group's website.\n\nMental health professionals support broadening access to mental health care but stress that mental illnesses are not the only factor behind mass shootings.\n\n\"I think we can see in this case a lot of times mental illness is just one of a number of complicated factors that leads someone to do something completely unexplainable,\" said Dr. Jonathan Metzl, director of the Center for Medicine, Health and Society, at Vanderbilt University.\n\nReinking's mental instability, his brushes with the law, access to family guns and differing gun laws in different states that may have allowed him to legally own guns are all contributing factors, Metzl said.\n\nSince the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, mental health has moved to the forefront of the debate over gun control and gun rights.\n\nThe gunman in that case was able to pass a background check despite having been treated at a Virginia hospital as a potential danger to himself or others.\n\nMore recently, the debate emerged again after the Parkland Shooting which claimed the lives of 14 students and three school officials on Feb. 14.\n\nSchool officials and a sheriff's deputy had sought to forcibly commit Nikolas Cruz for a mental evaluation a year before the deadly rampage, but their recommendation was never acted upon. Cruz was able to obtain a gun legally.\n\nIn Tennessee, officials are limited in their authority to remove weapons from individuals \u2013 even those who appear to pose a danger.\n\n\"Until someone commits a crime, there is no authority in the state of Tennessee to take someone's gun,\" said Judge Melissa Blackburn, a General Sessions judge who also presides over Nashville's Mental Health and Veterans Court.\n\nAfter the Parkland shooting, Blackburn and other judges worked with the city's Legal Department to analyze current laws related to gun ownership and mental illness, she said .\n\nWhat they found was the law prohibits mental health professionals at any of the state's inpatient psychiatric facilities from reporting people they have been determined to be mentally defective to local sheriffs or police.\n\nThe law says that those individuals may be reported to the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security or the FBI.\n\nThere is no mechanism that allows judges to take guns from people whom mental health professionals suspect are a danger but have not been convicted of a crime, Blackburn said.\n\n\"We have looked extensively at the law,\" she said. \"We need to get our legislators involved.\"\n\nA handful of states have enacted so-called \"red flag\" laws that typically allow law enforcement or family members to petition a court to temporarily remove guns from an individual who has displayed mental instability or made threats of violence.\n\nIn Tennessee, a bill introduced in January by two Memphis lawmakers would have allowed police officers to petition a judge for a temporary, three-week gun removal order for gun owners who could posed a risk to the public. The bill failed to get out of a legislative committee.\n\nAt a news conference on Tuesday, Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall called Sunday's mass shooting \"evidence that we have too many guns and too many mentally ill people.\n\n\"When you put those two things together in our community, the potential for things like this is going to exist,\" Hall said. \"My hope is we can find a way to reach people who are today suffering from mental illness that we can help, instead of one of these days having another one of these types of cases.\"\n\nReach Anita Wadhwani at awadhwani@tennessean.com, 615-259-8092 or on Twitter @AnitaWadhwani.\n\nWhy the Waffle House shooting stories are free\n\nThe Tennessean is lifting its paywall for coverage of the Waffle House shootings because it is imperative to tell this story to our community and beyond.

The 19-year-old, a former student of the school, went to the bathroom, where he put on a tactical vest and gloves. He then shot one round from his sawed-off shotgun through a classroom door, injuring one student, investigators said.\n\nThe shooting happened at about 8:30 a.m. Friday, on the 19th anniversary of the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado. It also came just months after a gruesome shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., reignited a nationwide debate over guns and created some of the loudest voices calling for gun control: the students themselves.\n\nStudents at Forest High School, like many others across the country, had planned a walkout Friday morning to protest gun violence, in observance of the Columbine anniversary. Instead, they experienced their own traumatic event.\n\n\n\nSky Bouche, 19, is facing several charges, including terrorism.

The wounded student was reported to have non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nOne of the teachers, Kelly McManis-Panasuk, said she saw Bouche in the hallway near her classroom just after a screaming student came running by. McManis-Panasuk talked to Bouche, who was her student before he dropped out.\n\n\u201cHis hands were up, and he said he wanted to be arrested,\u201d McManis-Panasuk told the Ocala Star Banner, adding that Bouche told her he is mentally ill. \u201cI asked, \u2018Did you shoot a gun?\u2019 He said he did shoot a gun.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post was unable to reach the teacher Saturday, but she told the Ocala Star Banner that her former student had been abused by his family and that this time, \u201che was done.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted to be arrested,\u201d McManis-Panasuk said. \u201cI really don\u2019t think he meant to shoot the gun.

Police said Reinking immediately lay on the ground and surrendered when an officer approached him with his gun drawn.\n\nReinking was taken to a hospital after his arrest and booked later Monday at the Hill Detention Center on four counts of criminal homicide.\n\nReinking requested a lawyer and refused to answer questions or make a statement, said Don Aaron, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department. He did not explain how Reinking eluded officers, police dogs and search helicopters, and he would not say what drove the suspect to allegedly open fire on apparent strangers early Sunday morning.\n\nReinking\u2019s bond was set at $2 million \u2014 $500,000 for each homicide count. He is scheduled to make his first appearance in court Wednesday morning.\n\nReinking had accumulated a long list of red flags in recent years; police said he showed signs of mental instability, had extensive run-ins with authorities, and had his firearms license revoked and his guns taken away by authorities last year. He allegedly carried out the mass shooting with one of the guns police had removed.\n\n1 of 21 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The scene after a gunman opened fire at a Waffle House in Nashville View Photos Four people died after a gunman opened fire at the restaurant early Sunday.

Jose Romero Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nLast summer, Reinking was arrested outside the White House after he tried to cross a security barrier, declaring himself a \u201csovereign citizen\u201d who wanted to speak with President Trump. The incident put Reinking under the scrutiny of the Secret Service and the FBI, as well as state and local police in Illinois, where he lived at the time.\n\nIn August, state and local authorities seized his guns and gave them to his father, Jeffrey Reinking, who agreed to keep the firearms secure and away from Travis, officials said. Since Sunday\u2019s shooting, the father has told police that he eventually gave the guns back to his son.\n\nFederal officials said Monday that the transfer was probably illegal and that the older Rein\u00adking might be charged. A young man answering the door at the Rein\u00adking family\u2019s house in Morton, Ill., said the family had no comment.\n\nPolice suspect that Travis Reinking is the gunman who opened fire at the Waffle House in Antioch just before 3:30 a.m. on Sunday, wearing nothing but a green jacket.\n\nThe man kept shooting as he walked inside, shattering the restaurant\u2019s glass windows. At one point, he stopped, presumably to reload. That\u2019s when customer James Shaw Jr. says he lunged at the gunman, wrestled the weapon away from him and tossed it over the counter.\n\n[James Shaw Jr. on why he rushed the Waffle House shooter: \u2018He was going to have to work to kill me\u2019]\n\nAmong the victims is 29-year-old Taurean C. Sanderlin of Goodlettsville, Tenn., a restaurant employee who was fatally shot while standing outside. The others killed were customers: Joe R. Perez, 20, of Nashville; Deebony Groves, 21, of Gallatin, Tenn.; and Akilah Dasilva, 23, of Antioch.\n\nTwo others \u2014 Shanita Waggoner, 21, of Nashville, and Sharita Henderson, 24, of Antioch \u2014 remained hospitalized at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in stable condition on Monday. After the shooting, police said, Reinking was spotted fleeing shirtless into a wooded area behind his apartment.\n\nJust an hour before arresting Reinking, police acknowledged having \u201cno confirmed sightings\u201d of the suspect. Even as authorities expanded their search, with 160 officers scouring surrounding neighborhoods, they said they weren\u2019t sure if he remained in the area.\n\nLate Sunday, a resident of a nearby county told police he had found an empty laptop bag containing a handwritten ID card with Reinking\u2019s name, Aaron said, suggesting that the 29-year-old was in that area the same night the shooting occurred. It remains unclear if the bag was dropped before or after the gunfire, police said.\n\nReinking\u2019s arrest provided few clues about his activities since the shooting. He was wearing a maroon shirt and had a backpack when taken into custody. Inside the backpack, police said, was a loaded handgun, .45-caliber ammunition, a flashlight and a holster.\n\nA long list of red flags\n\nBeginning in May 2016, Reinking had a number of increasingly fraught encounters with authorities. That month, an emergency response officer found Reinking in a CVS parking lot in Morton, Ill. Reinking told police that pop star Taylor Swift was stalking and harassing him, according to police records. Reinking believed that Swift had hacked into his Netflix account and that his family was involved in the harassment. He told police a bizarre story about a Dairy Queen meetup with Swift that ended with him searching for the singer on the restaurant\u2019s roof.\n\nHis parents told officers that he had threatened to kill himself and owned guns at home. Eventually, Reinking agreed to go to a hospital for evaluation, something he told police he had done before.\n\nOn June 16, 2017, police said, Reinking went to a local pool wearing a woman\u2019s pink housecoat; he swam in his underwear, exposed his genitals and tried to pick fights with lifeguards.\n\n[Mass shooting statistics: The terrible numbers that grow with each mass shooting]\n\nThat same day, records show that Reinking \u2014 who was living in a shop above the offices of his father\u2019s construction business in Tremont, Ill. \u2014 walked down to the offices wearing a pink dress, holding a rifle and shouting expletives at employees, before throwing the rifle in his car and speeding away.\n\nAn officer called his father, Jeffrey Reinking, who was out of state at the time, according to reports from the Tazewell County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The father told police that he had taken three rifles and a handgun away from Travis because his son was having problems. But he eventually returned the guns to his son.\n\nIn the report, an officer said he later called Jeffrey Reinking and told him that \u201cwhen he gets back home, he might want to lock the guns back up until Travis gets mental help which he stated he would.\u201d\n\nThree weeks later, Travis Reinking traveled to Washington and picked a fight with federal authorities.\n\nOn July 7, Reinking told authorities outside the White House that he had to get in to speak with the president. He said that \u201che was a sovereign citizen and has a right to inspect the grounds,\u201d according to a D.C. police report. Sovereign citizens are viewed by the FBI as anti-government extremists who believe they are not subject to governmental laws, and law enforcement officials have described them as a major concern.\n\n[\u2018There was so much left for him\u2019: Mourning for the victims of the Waffle House shooting]\n\nWhen an officer told him to stop blocking the entrance, Reinking \u201cbegan to take his tie off and balled it into a fist\u201d while walking past the security barriers and toward an officer, the police report says.\n\n\u201cDo what you need to do,\u201d Reinking said, according to the report. \u201cArrest me if you have to.\u201d\n\nReinking was charged with unlawful entry, a misdemeanor, officials said.\n\nHe was ordered to perform 32 hours of community service at Cornerstone Baptist Church in Morton, Ill., and to stay away from the White House for four months. He mowed grass, ran a forklift to move pallets of food, and packaged food for distribution to local food banks as well as hygiene packets for hurricane relief, according to court records.\n\nA letter signed by the church\u2019s pastor, the Rev. Steven. E. Hauter, says Reinking completed 33.5 hours of community service.\n\nA woman who answered the phone at the church Monday said Hauter was \u201cnot available, and we have no comments.\u201d\n\nProsecutors dismissed the case against Reinking in November after he completed the terms of the agreement.\n\nAfter an investigation by the FBI office in Springfield, Ill., the Tazewell County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Monday, it was asked by the Illinois State Police to take away Reinking\u2019s firearm owners identification (FOID) card, which he needed to legally possess guns or ammunition in Illinois.\n\nWhen a person\u2019s FOID card is revoked, they have to hand it over to authorities and fill out paperwork confirming that their guns have been transferred to someone who has a valid card, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nReinking signed his four guns over to his father on Aug. 24, 2017, according to state records. Matthew E. Espenshade, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Memphis division, said Monday that \u201cevery federal resource was brought to bear\u201d in Reinking\u2019s case after his arrest at the White House and the FBI assessment, pointing specifically to the attempts to keep him from possessing firearms.\n\n\u201cWe were able to effectively neutralize what we felt was the threat at the time by ensuring that he did not have the ability to purchase or own weapons and that those weapons were taken,\u201d Espenshade said. \u201cHe was not able to possess or own those weapons.\u201d\n\nIllinois State Police said they could not provide details about when Reinking obtained the FOID card or whether any red flags arose during his application. It was not immediately clear whether he had been diagnosed with any mental illness. Illinois law bars someone who has been \u201cadjudicated as a mental defective\u201d or has been a patient at a mental institution from obtaining a firearm license.\n\n\u2018That is your child\u2019\n\nThe Waffle House shooting is the latest attack to raise questions about the systems intended to prevent such violence \u2014 systems that have repeatedly broken down.\n\nIn Parkland, Fla., police and the FBI did not act upon explicit warnings that a teenager intended to shoot up a high school in the weeks and months before 17 people were killed there in February.\n\n[Tennessee community experiences second mass shooting in six months]\n\nIn Sutherland Springs, Tex., a gunman who killed more than two dozen churchgoers last year was able to buy firearms because his domestic violence conviction had not been entered into a national database that would have flagged it during his background check.\n\nThe FBI said a breakdown in the background check system also allowed a shooter in Charleston, S.C., to obtain the gun he used to kill nine people in a church there.\n\nThe Waffle House shooting is the second in less than a year to hit the town of Antioch, where a masked gunman opened fire at a church last year.\n\nLast fall, Reinking moved to the Nashville area and worked in the construction industry, authorities said. He was fired from a job about three weeks ago, police said, and was recently hired by another employer but had not been to work since April 16.\n\nA few days before the Waffle House shooting, Reinking nearly had another run-in with police. On Tuesday, authorities say he stole a BMW from a dealership in suburban Nashville. Police later tracked the car to Reinking\u2019s apartment complex but did not know who the thief was. After the shooting, a key fob for the BMW was found in Reinking\u2019s apartment, officials said.\n\nEmployees at the dealership \u201chad no idea who the man was\u201d who took the vehicle, Aaron said, noting that Reinking refused to give identification to the dealership. Police in Brentwood said charges are pending in the case.\n\nA neighbor near his family\u2019s home in Morton, Ill., said Reinking worked for a while for his father\u2019s company, J&J Cranes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good man. He was raised in a Christian home,\u201d said Bill Koepnick, who called Reinking hard-working and honest. \u201cA guy who perpetrates a crime like that naked? Come on, he\u2019s not in his right mind.\u201d\n\nBut Abede Dasilva, who was in the Waffle House with his brother, Akilah Dasilva, when Akilah was fatally shot, said he is struggling to understand why Reinking\u2019s family allowed him to keep his firearms.\n\n\u201cThat is your child,\u201d Dasilva said. \u201cIf something is mentally wrong with him, then you have to know that.
