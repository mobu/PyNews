{"Content":{"0":"There are a lot of gun terms thrown around in the media these days, like \u201cclip,\u201d \u201ccasings,\u201d and \u201csemi-automatic.\u201d But if you\u2019re not familiar with firearms, many of these terms might go over your head. This glossary of common gun lingo will help clear things up so you can be an informed part of the conversation.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, this is a sensitive subject, especially in light of the many recent tragedies that have occurred. But knowledge on the subject of guns is important\u2014no matter where you stand on the matter\u2014since misinformation does nothing but cause more confusion and frustration for everyone. Real discussion can only occur when we all understand the basic facts.\n\n\n\nIn alphabetical order, these are the gun terms you may not know:\n\nACP : An abbreviation of Automatic Colt Pistol. Designates various John Browning cartridge designs and calibers primarily used in Colt and Fabrique Nationale de Herstal semi-automatic pistols, like .45 ACP, .380 ACP, and .25 ACP.\n\n\n\n: An abbreviation of Automatic Colt Pistol.

AK-47 : An incredibly popular automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov, and first used in active service back in 1948. They are very reliable and cost very little to make so they\u2019re the gun of choice for many military and revolutionary outfits. As of 2004, \u201cOf the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov family, three-quarters of which are AK-47s\u201d\n\n\n\n: An incredibly popular automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov, and first used in active service back in 1948.

My life was fulfilled.\u201d\n\nRajneesh, who died in 1990, was a powerful spiritual guru who had thousands of followers in India and the West. In 1981, with the help of Sheela, who became his personal assistant, Rajneesh bought a ranch nearby the tiny town of Antelope, Oregon, and moved his cult there, creating a whole new city named Rajneeshpuram. It\u2019s no surprise that the situation snowballed, leading to heated confrontations with local residents, attempted murder, and mass poisoning. Wild Wild Country follows the saga in captivating ways, through historical footage as well as sit-down interviews with Sheela, who effectively ran the cult and was Rajneesh\u2019s spokesperson, and other members who had prominent roles, like Rajneesh\u2019s lawyer Swami Prem Niren.\n\nBut as Ronit Feinglass Plank notes in The Atlantic, the series doesn\u2019t really explain what the day-to-day life was like in Rajneeshpuram. And it doesn\u2019t really address how it\u2019s possible that thousands of people could just give up their lives, wear only maroon clothes, and blindly follow one man. What are the psychological mechanisms at play?\n\nRajneesh preached to his followers about the idea of creating awakened people who live in harmony with their surroundings. But his cult also forced members to donate large quantities of money, while creating an isolated community that kept tight control over its members. The Netflix documentary doesn\u2019t show this, but Win McCormack, who wrote about the cult in the 1980s, points out in The New Republic that Rajneesh\u2019s followers were encouraged to get sterilized or have abortions. (For more on Rajneesh and his cult, read The Oregonian\u2019s 20-part investigation from the 1980s.)\n\nRajneesh was just one of many cult leaders who have captivated \u2014 and horrified \u2014 people throughout history. In 1978, cult leader Jim Jones urged more than 900 of his followers to kill themselves by drinking poison in Jonestown, Guyana. In 1993, in a standoff with government officials, more than 75 Branch Davidians died in a building fire in Waco, Texas, together with their leader David Koresh. All of these groups, and many more less prominent cult organizations, have some things in common. I talked with Louis Manza, chair and professor of psychology at Lebanon Valley College about how cult leaders control their followers, when people are most vulnerable to cults, and the difference between cults and religions.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nHow do cult leaders like Rajneesh exert control over their followers?\n\nThey can take a lot of approaches, obviously. On a real simple level, they could take control in a very physical way, restraining someone from leaving a space, but that doesn\u2019t seem to happen a whole lot. It\u2019s more of a psychological control. If you look historically at different types of cults, there\u2019s always an indoctrination period where the cult leader is going to form a bond with people. Once they have that bond, now they can get inside of someone\u2019s head, because now those people start to trust that person. And now the leader can start to make other suggestions to them: \u201cYou should move away from your family.\u201d \u201cYou should come live with us.\u201d Etc. That\u2019s one of the critical things: there has to be that emotional connection that\u2019s made by the person who\u2019s running everything with the people they want to bring in with them. If you don\u2019t have that connection, it\u2019s going to be really hard to get people to do anything.\n\nWhat kinds of psychological mechanisms do cults use to keep their members in line?\n\nOnce someone forms a bond with a person, you can use that to your advantage, to a certain extent. You can withhold certain types of things. If you\u2019re the cult leader, [you can decide] we all get to meet at this point in time, and we all get to talk about our feelings, but you can\u2019t come this week because you\u2019ve been misbehaving, or you\u2019re not been pulling your share, or whatever the case might be. Once you have that relationship with that person, punishing [or rewarding] them can get something out of them. Again, it\u2019s not a physical-restraint type of thing, but it is a form of control.\n\nThey\u2019re also paying attention to what works, the same way that a spouse pays attention to what works with their significant other, the same way a parent pays attention with their kids. [Parents] can punish their children by making them stand in a corner for 10 minutes, and that works because that kid doesn\u2019t like to stand in a corner. But for another kid, that doesn\u2019t work, so they have to find something else. So they take the tablet away from them, or they don\u2019t let them watch television. People who are very good at understanding other people, are very good at paying attention, can get inside someone\u2019s head and then exploit that. But the person who\u2019s exploited has to be exploitable. If someone is in a good place psychologically, then they\u2019re most likely not going to be exploitable.\n\n\u201cPeople who are very good at understanding other people, are very good at paying attention, can get inside someone\u2019s head and then exploit that.\u201d\n\nWhen are people most vulnerable to a cult?\n\nOn a simple level, when they\u2019re in a state of psychological instability \u2014 if something is not quite right in their life, if they\u2019re missing something, especially on a relationship perspective. We are social creatures. There\u2019s going to be some variability there; some people like much larger social circles than others, some people like to live in a cabin in the woods by themselves. But the majority of us fall in the middle. It\u2019s part of what makes us humans. And so if that\u2019s missing for individuals, and they don\u2019t have a way of meeting that need on their own, they\u2019re going to look for someone else who can maybe provide that need for them. Now, lots of people will join \u201ccults\u201d as a way of satisfying that. Other people will join other types of groups.\n\nI compete in ultramarathons, so I do a couple races a year. And that kind of satisfies that need for me. Now, is that a cult? I don\u2019t think so, not in a way we define a cult, when you think of like the Jonestown massacre and Jim Jones. If you\u2019re into certain sports teams, that social need is being met there. It\u2019s just that idea that someone needs some type of social connection. I think it\u2019s one of the primary forces. If they simply can\u2019t find a way on their own to fulfill that, and then someone comes along and says, \u201cHey, we have this group. And you\u2019re welcome. Join us!\u201d it can be a very subtle thing at first. If you want to get someone in, and you know how to manipulate people, it\u2019s fairly simple to do: you bring them in, you establish the relationship, and then you just start sucking them in more and more, and eventually, someone just crosses a line and they\u2019re in. And then they can have a hard time getting out, because now they have that social need being met. It can be a very subtle process along those lines.\n\nWhat do cult leaders have in common?\n\nThey tend to be charismatic. Historically, if you think of the people we call cult leaders, like David Koresh, James Jones, they all had a certain charisma. That goes back to what I was saying about forming social bonds. If you can\u2019t attract people to you, then you\u2019re going to be hard-pressed to form a cult. Beyond that, it\u2019s going to depend. You have to understand people, you gotta know what\u2019s going on inside of their heads, you gotta talk to them, you gotta be able to pull information out of them. Those are skills. All of us use them in different ways. I\u2019ve been teaching since 1992, so I know if I do this, I will get students to interact in class. Is that a form of manipulation? Sure it is. I wouldn\u2019t put it up with the same kind of manipulation that a cult leader is doing, but they are also doing that. They\u2019re understanding people, they\u2019re studying people. They develop that kind of skill-set, but I think charisma has to be at the top of it, because just knowing people, it\u2019s a skill people can acquire. Being charismatic and understanding people, that\u2019s another thing altogether.\n\nPeople who are in power also like to keep that power, and they don\u2019t want to give that power up. The cult leader wants to control people, to a certain degree. When you look at people who run these organizations, if you look at the more historically famous ones, they had a need to control people, and when that control got pushed up against, they pushed back. When David Koresh and the Branch Davidians went down, Koresh didn\u2019t want to give up control of those people. And you had the gun fight and the burning of a building and all that. Jim Jones didn\u2019t want give up control of those hundreds of people in Jonestown, and people died. I think wanting to control is a driving force from the leader, and wanting to belong is the driving force for the member. You put those things together, you create the perfect storm for getting people into a cult.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a cult and a religion?\n\nReligions are an organized belief system, and cults are organized belief systems. People will engage in lots of behaviors on the part of their religion, that can be very good but it can also be very bad. People have killed other individuals in the name of their religion. Now, will Catholics prevent you from leaving the church? Not to my knowledge. I was raised Catholic. I\u2019m an atheist now. Now one held me back. So what we usually consider cults tend to exert a bit more control over their members, but that\u2019s not to say that that control doesn\u2019t happen in more organized, traditional religions. But with cults, you see that real psychological, physical-restraint thing kick in to a much higher degree than you see in Catholics, Lutherans, or whatever. If there is a dividing line, it\u2019s along those lines, but they definitely share a lot of features, because they\u2019re organized belief systems.\n\nBut there are lot of things that are not even religions or cults that are organized belief systems. Again, if you\u2019re part of a certain sports team, you have an organized belief system. But mental manipulation, psychological manipulation is something you tend to see more in cults than in organized religion.","2":"There are few gambles in the tech world as big spending billions to build a new computer processor from scratch. Former AMD board member Robert Palmer supposedly compared it to Russian roulette: \u201cYou put a gun to your head, pull the trigger, and find out four years later if you blew your brains out.\u201d Six years ago AMD loaded the gun and pulled the trigger, dramatically restructuring itself internally in a mad bid to escape a disaster of its own making. Now we\u2019ve seen the results and instead of dying, AMD has a savvy new CPU microarchitecture, Zen, that\u2019s the foundation of the shockingly good new series of Ryzen processors. They\u2019re so good, in fact, that they could pose a real challenge to Intel\u2019s incumbent dominance and change what the computer market looks for the next few years.\n\n\u201cI think Intel kind of woke up and said \u2018hey you know we\u2019re in a battle all of a sudden,\u2019\u201d Linley Gwenapp, an analyst, and editor of the Microprocessor Report, an industry magazine, told Gizmodo. \u201cSo they\u2019re not going to just stand by and let AMD storm into the market.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Intel has its work cut out for it. In January at CES in Las Vegas, I met with both companies and the mood could not have been more different. Intel seemed to spend the entire consumer electronics show apologizing for Spectre and Meltdown, a series of catastrophic security vulnerabilities that affected every one of the company\u2019s CPUs. It seemed to barely have time to tease all the cool stuff it had coming out in the next few months. AMD, meanwhile, was a peacock\u2014fluttering its feathers and bragging about its plans to continue one of the most aggressive launches in CPU history. The fact that it was vulnerable to Meltdown was almost an aside. AMD was way too busy being thrilled to be back, doing something very cool, and not being the one with all the bad press for once.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s been very successful when you look at where they were a year ago,\u201d Gwenapp said of AMD. Because even just a year ago the company was in rough shape. According to Gwenapp, AMD had as little as 1.5 percent of the server market share last year. Intel had the other 98.5 percent. Sure it was making the chips that power every single Xbox One and PS4, and yes it\u2019s the exclusive provider of GPUs for Apple machines, but to anyone who was paying attention, it sure seemed like AMD was a shadow of its former self. After all, the company was once considered Intel\u2019s only serious rival in the CPU space, and until Zen was announced, AMD had been virtually silent on that front, effectively capitulating the multi-billion market for the chips that serve as the brains for everything from your computer to the servers powering your favorite websites.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Gizmodo\n\nAMD\u2019s last big push in the CPU space came with a microarchitecture called Bulldozer back in 2011. In the tech world that\u2019s an eternity. To put it in perspective, the same year AMD was last seriously attempting to compete with Intel, Apple launched the iPhone 4s, and Intel launched the second generation of its Core architecture. Intel is now on generation eight and expected to launch its ninth by the end of the year. It\u2019s been eons since Intel and AMD were serious competitors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the biggest reasons it\u2019s taken so long for AMD to compete again is because that last big CPU launch was disastrous. Bulldozer obviously wasn\u2019t intended to be awful. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as if somebody architected something that people thought wouldn\u2019t be successful,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, Founder and Prinicipal Anaylyst at Moorhead Strategy, told Gizmodo. Before becoming an analyst, Moorhead was a VP at AMD for nearly 10 years and departed at the same time Bulldozer came to market.\n\nAccording to Moorhead, Bulldozer was always intended to be a high octane kind of CPU that blazed past its Intel competitors thanks to its high clock rate (or clockspeed). The higher the clockspeed the more cycles of processing a CPU can potentially undergo in a second, and according to Moorhead, AMD had planned a clock rate of 5GHz, which is over five billion processes every second. Intel\u2019s competitor at the time shipped CPUs with a much lower clockrate\u2014only a handful could hit 4GHz.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why when people say \u2018oh we didn\u2019t get out of Bulldozer what we would have wanted\u2019 it\u2019s because that was supposed to be a very high frequency part,\u201d Moorhead said. In fact no CPU in general production from AMD or Intel has ever hit a clockrate of 5Ghz or higher. The only CPU to ever go into production with such a high clockrate is the IBM zEC12 released in 2012 and intended solely for IBM mainframes.\n\n\u201cIt was never really competitive.\u201d\n\nWhen Bulldozer went into production it had a base clockrate of just 4.2GHz with a turbo clock rate (which is enabled when the processor needs to crank through a little data very quickly) of 4.5GHz. And the respectable clock rate couldn\u2019t compete with Intel\u2019s offerings in the same space. The reaction from reviewers was brutal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnandtech\u2019s Anand Lal Shimpi wrote that he was \u201cnot sure it\u2019s quite ready for prime time\u201d and that \u201cBulldozer simply does not perform.\u201d Tom\u2019s Hardware noted that it was often \u201cembarrassingly bested by its predecessor\u201d while Tweaktown lamented that \u201cyou can\u2019t help but almost feel disappointed with what\u2019s going on here today.\u201d\n\nWhen CNET did a round up of the geekier reviews of Bulldozer it reported that \u201cBulldozer does not appear to offer AMD a competitive resurgence.\u201d But it was at least a little hopeful AMD could stick around in the CPU space, if for no other reason than \u201cto keep Intel honest.\u201d\n\nYet that didn\u2019t happen. AMD had come out of the gate with a troubled architecture and the gap between it and Intel only grew wider over each successive annual iteration. The company tried \u201cto start with something that doesn\u2019t work well and then kludge it up to make it better,\u201d Gwenapp told Gizmodo. But with each new iteration based on the already underperforming Bulldozer architecture it couldn\u2019t keep up. \u201cIt never really was competitive.\u201d\n\nIt takes guts\n\nAnd a CPU absolutely must be competitive\u2014either cheaper, faster, or more power efficient. It is the core brain that powers every computer you use\u2014from your phone to your laptop to your TV. A CPU defined by its microprocessor\u2014which is in many cases a synonym for CPU. It\u2019s a wafer of silicon that then has billions of microcircuits etched to its surface and connected to one another via ions of copper. The specific way a CPU\u2019s silicon microcircuits\u2014or transistors\u2014are arranged and connected via copper is called its \u201carchitecture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe very first microprocessor, the Intel 4004 released in 1971, was built on a die, or foundation, that was just 10,000nm. That is as thick as a very thin strand of human hair. The Ryzen CPU is just 14nm. A small process means it can move energy across those copper ions faster\u2014effectively meaning that the smaller a CPU gets the faster it can be. But the smaller a CPU is the more delicate it becomes. So in the bid to make the fastest and most powerful processors, CPU designers must also make them smaller and more intricate. And that means always optimizing and seeking better efficiencies.\n\nConsequently each CPU is designed for a specific \u201cinstruction set.\u201d That is the most basic code that works between a CPU and a devices software. Common CPU instruction sets you\u2019ve heard of are ARM and x86. ARM CPUs are usually found in phones and tablets\u2014the CPUs that power you Samsung GalaxyS9 and your iPhone X are ARM-based processors. x86 CPUs are usually reserved for computing devices that need a lot more power and a little less battery life. Intel and AMD\u2019s CPUs for laptops, desktops, and servers are x86, and unless specifically specified, as are AMD\u2019s competitors, including its new batch of Ryzen processors.\n\nBeyond the instruction set CPUs, are actually pretty simple and just made up of a few key components: cores, CPU caches, and the system bus. The cores are the engine of the CPU, they\u2019re the things doing all the actual processing and when you talk about the clockrate of a CPU you\u2019re talking about how fast those cores are operating. The cores do all the actual processing required by the CPU, but they\u2019re very busy processing all that data you feed them, so they need to cache bits of it away for super quick references.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is where CPU caches come in. They are the memory. When you glance at the specs for a computer you\u2019re planning to buy you might see a mention of these caches, usually labelled L1, L2, and L3. They\u2019re important because they\u2019re what the cores actually read and write data to while processing. That data, after being processed on the CPU caches, is then sent back out to the general memory (also known as RAM) for the computer, and then possibly onto the storage drive, and it all gets to your eyeballs because it goes through the graphics processing unit.\n\nThe CPU caches and the cores communicate to one another via the system bus. It\u2019s called a bus because it\u2019s essentially busing information from one part of the CPU to another. And sometimes it\u2019s not just moving data between the cores and the CPU caches. A system bus will also move data to and from a graphics processor if its squeezed onto the same chip too. At its most rudimentary, consider a system bus to be like that little green board you used to snap all the Lego bricks onto.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are a lot of different kinds of system buses, and every major CPU maker has their own system bus architecture. So Intel has what it calls Front Side Bus, and until Zen, AMD used tech called HyperTransport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, focusing on any one of these components can improve the speed of a CPU,. When AMD created Bulldozer it put all its effort into the clockrate of the cores of the CPU. The clockrate is the frequency at which a computer processing unit can actually process cycles of data. More processes means a faster CPU and for a very long time improving the clockrate of a CPU was the primary goal of designers.\n\nBut in the early 2000s, Intel brought a CPU to market with a clockrate of 3GHz, and since then nearly all CPUs have hovered around that clockrate. One of the reasons for that stall in clockrate increases is because the higher the clockrate the more heat the CPU produces. Getting rid of all that heat can be costly\u2014especially if you\u2019re trying to pack that CPU into something super slim and fanless like a Surface Pro.\n\nSo in recent years, CPU designers have turned other parts of the CPU to improve speed, and when AMD made the decision to essentially scrap Bulldozer and put most of its resources into what would be come Zen, one particular component of the CPU would get a brunt of the focus: A new system bus architecture called Infinity Fabric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut before AMD settled on Infinity Fabric, before it even settled on creating a new CPU and acknowledging Bulldozer\u2019s failure, the company needed a new CPU design team.\n\nPhoto: Alex Cranz (Gizmodo)\n\nTheir powers combined\n\nEnter Mark Papermaster, current Chief Technology Officer for AMD. He joined the company in late 2011, just after Bulldozer\u2019s launch, and according to him \u201cit was not a coincidence.\u201d Papermaster had been brought in to help save a company that saw its stock prices plummet more than 60-percent in a year thanks in part to Bulldozer\u2019s poor performance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore joining AMD Papermaster was primarily noteworthy for two things. In 2008 he was the subject of a highly publicized lawsuit with IBM, where he\u2019d worked since 1982. IBM was concerned that Papermaster, then a recent hire at Apple, would potentially carry trade secrets with him from IBM to Apple. The case settled out of court. Then Papermaster made headlines again in 2010, when he reportedly left Apple after just 15 months due to disagreements with then CEO Steve Jobs.\n\nPapermaster entered AMD in October 2011 and the company seemed to be in a state of free fall, with major rivals like Qualcomm, Apple, and Samsung snapping up dissatisfied employees. The flight of employees struck a nerve with some. \u201cThat just breaks my heart,\u201d former AMD founder Jerry Sanders told Forbes in February 2012.\n\nThe company was in disarray and Papermaster was himself contributing to it. Not because of his previous reputation, but because one of his first orders of business was to dramatically restructure the CPU design team. He\u2019d seen how bad Bulldozer was doing and it was clear to him it wasn\u2019t the processor AMD needed to succeed. \u201cI saw the market going to high performance,\u201d he told Gizmodo. \u201cTo do that we needed a new CPU.\u201d Instead of something that could just handle your web browsing, Papermaster was certain the market needed something that could handle gaming, or processing huge 3D files, or rendering big 4K videos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for Papermaster, a new CPU meant a major restructuring of AMD\u2019s design group. Traditionally the CPU design group was was broken up into two basic teams. \u201cPrior to the Zen architecture they really had two kind of parallel design tracks,\u201d Natalie Jerger, a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, told Gizmodo. One processor was intended for low powered laptops and desktops\u2014the cheapest of the cheap. The other was intended for servers and high end desktops. The server class processors were Bulldozer, and the low power CPUs were what was called the Bobcat family.\n\n\u201cAnd so what [Papermaster] did was he merged these two teams together,\u201d Joe Macri, Corporate Vice President and Product CTO at AMD, told Gizmodo. Macri was one of the leaders of that new, larger team.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo hear him tell it, the merging of the two teams (and the removal of anyone made redundant) seemed like a necessity for the task Papermaster assigned to the larger group. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to start from scratch,\u201d Macri said. \u201cSo that was really more of a merge than taking an existing team, rip it apart, and put it back together. But in the process we got a lot of efficiencies. We were able to apply more people to a single function and get much more design bandwidth.\u201d Bandwidth that would be necessary to accomplish Papermaster\u2019s goal of building a CPU that was in every way better than that rubbish it had just released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPapermaster was soon aided by another new exec at AMD: Lisa Su, who joined as Senior Vice President and General Manager in January 2012. Su had come from Freescale, another CPU maker that has since merged with NXP Semiconductors. Her first focus was on AMD\u2019s graphics and gaming markets\u2014where the company was actually having some successes. Su and then CEO Rory Read, secured deals with both Sony and Microsoft to create the chips at the heart of the Playstation 4 and Xbox One.\n\nThose deals were enormous, and many sources cite AMD\u2019s work on custom chips for Sony and Microsoft as one of the reasons the company both survived the CPU drought and actually managed to produce such an effective CPU with its current architecture, Zen.\n\nSu\u2019s work earned her quick notice and by October of 2014, a little more than two years after she\u2019d joined AMD, she was elevated to CEO. Su and Papermaster then proceeded to pour resources into the development of Zen. According to Macri it was over two million man hours spread over four years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Papermaster, putting all those resources into a new CPU design, and having that team effectively ignore Bulldozer and its successive iterations, was absolutely vital. He needed a team that would have the breathing room \u201cto get those bright ideas that they had.\u201d He felt that some of AMD\u2019s coolest ideas for new CPUs \u201chad been on the shelf because there had been such a demanding schedule of new revision after new revision.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou know sometimes you can get a \u2018let\u2019s do a from scratch design and throw everything out.\u2019 The team didn\u2019t do that.\u201d Instead the team pulled from AMD\u2019s extensive back catalog to use ideas that hadn\u2019t been given a lot of focus over the years. One such idea was improving on the system bus architecture HyperTransport and creating a new one: Infinity Fabric.\n\n\n\nMark Papermaster told Gizmodo AMD called it \u201cthe hidden gem,\u201d while Jim Anderson told Gizmodo it was the \u201csecret sauce.\u201d\n\nMr. Infinity\n\nThis is where a talented engineer named Jim Keller comes in. He\u2019s a mythical sort of figure within AMD. Nearly every person I spoke to cited Keller as one of the primary people behind the success of Zen\u2019s design, and importantly behind the design of Infinity Fabric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPapermaster hired Keller in 2012 and put him in charge of the processor group. Keller was no stranger to AMD. He\u2019d worked there previously in the \u201890s and his short tenure had achieved legendary status in the geeky processor community online where he is credited as the principal figure behind AMD\u2019s K8 microarchitecture which allowed the company to be viciously competitive with Intel in the late \u201890s and early 2000s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeller and Papermaster had worked at Apple together, where Keller is credited with designing the first CPUs Apple built itself for its iPhones and iPads. When he came to AMD, both he and his new employer agreed to come under a limited time contract. He would work at AMD for three years, and at the end of that contract he would depart, which he did in 2015. He now designs chips for the autopilot feature in Tesla\u2019s cars, and declined to comment for this story. [Update: The morning of publication, Intel announced that Jim Keller had jointed the company as the SVP for Silicon Engineering. The plot thickens!]\n\nKeller, and in particular his work on mobile CPUs and previous work on HyperTransport, were key. Without Keller to speak for himself we\u2019re left with glowing praise from AMD execs like Mark Papermaster and Jim Anderson, and from analysts like Linley Gwenapp who said \u201cI think Jim and his team really has turned around the company from a technology standpoint.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a rare public interview in 2014 with Papermaster, you start to get a sense of Keller\u2019s enthusiasm and motivation. \u201cI joined AMD because I love processor design and I love complicated systems design and AMD was looking at taking a big swing on the next generation,\u201d Keller said.\n\nKeller seems calm and polished up on the little stage, but he tends to ramp up in response to geekier questions\u2014growing sharper and more and more animated as he talks about architectures and pipelines and cores and the other supremely technical stuff that most of us would yawn at.\n\nThe interview is a great look at where Zen was in 2014\u2014three years before its launch. At the time it was only approximately two years into its development, and still being designed alongside K12\u2014AMD\u2019s planned next generation ARM CPU. In the interview, Keller actually cites that co-development as an asset to Zen and specifically to the cores at the heart of each Zen CPU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever Keller doesn\u2019t hint at the most important component until near the end of the 15 minute session when he mentions a next generation \u201cfabric\u201d that would be found in every CPU from mobile devices up to servers and that would allow AMD to scale performance at an enviable rate. That fabric would be known, by 2017, as Infinity Fabric.\n\n\u201cAMD has found a way to have their cake and eat it too.\u201d\n\nHe explains that the fabric would allow AMD to employ a \u201cchiplet\u201d approach to design. Instead of building one processor on a single die AMD could package a series of processors together\u2014connecting them via the Infinity Fabric system bus. This would make the CPUs way cheaper to produce and ideally as fast as a CPU, like AMD\u2019s previous CPUs and most of the ones from Intel, that included all the cores on a one die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHistorically,\u201d analyst Patrick Moorhead told Gizmodo, \u201cwhen you put things in packages it slows down the process. But AMD has found a way to have their cake and eat it too by coming up with this packaging that sets very high performance.\u201d\n\nAnd this packaging also meant AMD was designing a very different kind of CPU from its competitor, with a different, and according to AMD, much more efficient methodology. \u201cWe came up with a very regular structure for it,\u201d Joe Macri told Gizmodo. \u201cWe basically had a data point and a control point and everybody that bolted into [Infinity Fabric] bolted into it the same way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMacri claims Infinity Fabric actually sped up design of the processors across the board. The modular design it gave the Zen architecture meant AMD didn\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel for every kind of CPU. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges in designing a core is actually validating it,\u201d Macri said. And thanks to Infinity Fabric AMD could quickly validate, or confirm the operation of, a whole slew of slightly varied designs ranging across their entire offering of Zen processors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink of Infinity Fabric as the little snaps in Lego blocks and all the components of a CPU as the blocks themselves. AMD could take a few blocks to build a desktop CPU, or tack on more to create a big multi-core server processor, or snap on a GPU to make a wicked fast chip intended for laptops.\n\nOr, as happened in 2016\u2014an entirely new type of CPU for AMD.\n\nImage: Gizmodo\n\nThe breakthrough\n\nReleased in 2017, Threadripper\u2014AMD\u2019s perhaps most eye catching CPU launched on Zen\u2014was never on any of Papermaster\u2019s aggressive roadmaps. Instead it was a passion project by a very small group of engineers\u2014like maybe four. A \u201cvery, very small group,\u201d Robert Hallock, AMD Evangelist for APUs and CPUs said. He shared the same row of cubicles with them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company had wanted to do a really big and powerful desktop CPU for a while, but it had never been feasible technologically or financially speaking. Yet this tiny group of engineers realized that they could potentially take advantage of the chiplet design made possible by Infinity Fabric to build an incredibly powerful desktop CPU to rival Intel\u2019s popular top-end Xeon CPUs. Yet instead of the 8 cores found on the Xeon processors used in beefy workstations, the Threadripper would have a whopping 16 cores\u2014the most ever put in a mass-produced desktop CPU.\n\nSuch a CPU should take years to design, test, and push into the market place right? According to Jim Anderson the tiny team didn\u2019t even approach him about it until January 2016, when they pulled him aside during CES in Las Vegas. He said he immediately recognized the sheer cool factor of these chips and insisted on putting the project on a fast track, taking it from their concept to production in just a little over a year.\n\nThe project was steeped in secrecy, referred to only as Summit P3\u2014which many assumed was a minor offshoot of Ryzen\u2014then call Summit Ridge, and according to Hallock \u201cyou were not even allowed to send emails\u201d about the project. Everything, from the look to the speed results were closely guarded until launch and even the teams trying to convince PC makers like Dell to adopt the CPU had almost no details on the product itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet when Threadripper did finally launch in the summer of 2017, it shocked critics and consumers alike, and was quickly adopted by some of the largest PC makers in the world, including Alienware\u2019s top-of-the-line gaming desktops.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the audacity of Threadripper\u2019s design that intrigued people. Yes 16 cores running 32 threads in a desktop PC anyone can build is impressive, but Intel announced an 18-core i9 processor just two weeks after Threadripper was announced. What was surprising was that it was cheap\u2014$1,000 to the $2,000 for Intel\u2019s 18-core processor\u2014and the damn thing was actually as fast.\n\nPhoto: Gizmodo\n\nMore than anything else, this is what has surprised observers about AMD\u2019s latest CPU architecture: The chips are cheaper and usually faster than their Intel competition. You can look at our own reviews of AMD processors over the last year as proof (here, here, and here).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet AMD isn\u2019t just producing fast, cheap processors processors, it\u2019s also releasing them all of a sudden at a surprisingly fast clip. In 2017 AMD released four categories of CPUs based on Zen: Ryzen desktop CPUs, Threadripper, Epyc CPUs intended for servers, and Ryzen APUs for laptops (APU is the AMD term for a CPU with integrated graphics). We\u2019re only four months into 2018 and AMD has already released incredibly fast and cheap APUs for the desktop, additional mobile APUs for laptops, and even a second generation of Ryzen CPUs for desktops.\n\nJim Anderson told Gizmodo he anticipates over 60 new laptops and desktops with Ryzen inside by the end of the year, with most of those systems being laptops, and most of those laptops coming in the next few months. \u201cThis will be the widest range of premium notebook systems that you\u2019ve ever seen from AMD in the company\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nHow good those laptops are remains to be seen. So far there are only a handful of AMD-based laptops actually in the marketplace, and we still don\u2019t have a good sense of how well a mobile Zen processor handles power compared to its Intel rival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if it\u2019s not quite as good at power management, it\u2019s still okay. Because Intel has clearly noticed AMD\u2019s strides into the CPU space and has responded accordingly. Last year Intel\u2019s top of the line desktop CPU maxed out at 4 cores, but after AMD released a 6-core processor Intel quickly responded with its own 6-core device. And when AMD surprised us with the 16-core Threadripper, Intel raced to get the 18-core i9 into the marketplace.\n\nA rivalry between the two companies can only ever be good for all of us hunting for our next computer. \u201cYou know,\u201d Natalie Jerger told Gizmodo, \u201cthe the world is much more exciting if we have multiple people trying to innovate in this space.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis post has been updated to reflect that former AMD-engineer Jim Keller has moved on to Intel from Tesla.","3":"As young survivors of the Parkland shooting lead efforts to tighten limits on firearms, they have met deep resistance from strong supporters of gun rights, and both sides have dug in. But the renewed national gun debate \u2014 reignited again after the shooting in the Nashville Waffle House \u2014 has gotten the attention of a subset of people who are often overlooked: gun control supporters who own guns.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany of these gun owners will never take part in marches or make public speeches. But interviews with two dozen gun owners around the country found what polls have shown \u2014 that many of them are firm supporters of some gun control measures. In recent weeks, some have grown more vocal, holding signs at demonstrations, lobbying lawmakers or writing letters to the editor, adding their voices to those of the protesting students.\n\nOf the 60 million to 70 million Americans who own guns, measuring how many are likely to take part in activism in favor of gun control or to change their political choices over the issue is difficult. One rough proxy for those who do not want tougher gun laws could be the five million gun owners the National Rifle Association claims as members, said Robert Spitzer, the chairman of the political science department at the State University of New York at Cortland, who has written extensively about gun policy and politics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe N.R.A. is staunchly opposed to new gun control measures, and events following the Parkland shooting may have deepened the resolve of its supporters. In March, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the N.R.A. Political Victory Fund raised $2.35 million \u2014 the highest monthly amount raised for the fund in records dating back to 2003, according to an analysis by the news outlet McClatchy and verified by The New York Times. The N.R.A. did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nOnly a small number of gun owners seem to be stepping forward in activism in favor of stricter gun laws, and not all agree about which laws should be toughened. But advocacy groups that support increased gun control say they sense a new kind of participation in more subtle ways, such as calls from gun owners wanting to know what the groups do, and a greater willingness to listen. The shift could also have political implications: Some gun owners said they are now paying closer attention to which political candidates receive money from the N.R.A., which takes a hard line against firearm limits.\n\n\n\nAfter the Parkland shooting, Lindsey Donovan, an Army veteran in Georgia who is a member of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said she began getting calls and inquiries from distant corners of that state, including gun shop owners in tiny towns \u201cwanting to talk about what it is we are about.\u201d Conversations about gun restrictions with friends in the military, she said, seemed to grow more searching and less combative.\n\n\u201cThey are not shutting me down anymore,\u201d Ms. Donovan said.\n\nBefore Parkland, her organization in Georgia had five local groups. Now there are 12. Around 1,800 people showed up to the organization\u2019s annual advocacy day in Atlanta in late February, up from 150 last year. And local chapter meetings used to draw around 30 people on any given night. Now it\u2019s often more than 100 showing up.\n\nDr. Spitzer said gun owners who favor gun limits reflect an often-silent middle who could be powerful allies for gun control groups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dog that doesn\u2019t bark,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a voice that\u2019s not heard.\u201d\n\nLong before Parkland, he said, gun owners who are not members of the N.R.A. have tended to see things differently than members. A 2009 survey by Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, found that 30 percent of N.R.A. members supported a ban on assault weapons, compared with 47 percent of gun owners who were not members \u2014 closer to the views of the general public in such polls.\n\nSurvey data has long shown gun owners to be broadly supportive of some restrictions on firearms. Polling just after the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland suggested a small uptick in support for stronger gun laws in gun-owning households. A poll by Quinnipiac University between Feb. 16 and 19 found that 50 percent of respondents in gun-owning households supported stricter gun laws \u2014 a figure that was seven percentage points higher than when people were asked the same question last December. In February, 97 percent of respondents in gun-owning households said they supported background checks for all gun buyers, compared with 94 percent in December. (The 1994 Brady Bill created a requirement for gun buyers to pass a background check, but the rule does not apply to private sellers online or at gun shows.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWith the N.R.A. opposed to expanding background checks, gun control groups have focused on the issue as a way to reach out to gun owners.\n\nWhen the gun control advocacy organization founded by Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman who in 2011 was shot in the head during an event with constituents, wanted to marshal support for a raft of proposed gun laws in Vermont, the organization worked with a local consultant, who reached out to gun owners. Before long, 61 gun owners in the state, including Mr. Galinat, had signed on to a letter to lawmakers, urging them to expand background checks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an ardent advocate for the Second Amendment, and none of those gun safety measures threaten any of those things that I believe in,\u201d said Mr. Galinat, who also went to Montpelier for a news conference on the issue. He said his only quibble with the letter, which was written by the consultant and a local gun safety group, was that he wanted lawmakers to set even stronger gun limits.\n\nSome gun owners said the Parkland shooting motivated them to be more vocal about their support for background checks, or about long simmering discontent with the N.R.A.\n\n\u201cWhat put me over the edge was this series of recent tragedies, both in schools and in other areas, and they just never budged,\u201d John S. Liccardi said of the N.R.A. Mr. Liccardi, 73, a hunter from Rutland, Vt., who owns several guns, stepped publicly into the gun debate for the first time in March. He denounced the N.R.A. in an op-ed for the news website VTDigger.\n\n\u201cIf there ever is going to be any progress in sensible gun ownership and control,\u201d Mr. Liccardi said, \u201cit has to be from the middle ground.\u201d\n\nSome members of gun-owning families have entered the debate hesitantly. Karen Fowkes from Vienna, Va., joined a sea of people at the March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C., last month. Her husband owned a gun, she said, and she initially worried about feeling hypocritical, but joined her daughter, Colleen, at the march after some convincing.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Mom, this is not an anti-gun march,\u2019\u201d the younger Ms. Fowkes said. \u201cI asked, \u2018Are you for universal background checks?\u2019 She said, \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo that, the younger Ms. Fowkes told her mother, \u201cYou are for gun control, too!\u201d\n\nBut for other gun owners, the marches had the opposite effect.\n\n\u201cI have a little bit more trepidation now,\u201d said Rob Mason, 47, an educational aide at a high school in Maineville, Ohio, outside Cincinnati, who owns several guns and practices shooting with his children at a range. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s going too far.\u201d\n\nMr. Mason, who is not an N.R.A. member, said he supports universal background checks. But he is uncomfortable with the notion of an assault-rifle ban. His daughter, Grace, who is 16, went to a march in Ohio. He was proud she participated. But he also felt worried. The marchers\u2019 demands seemed fluid and ill-defined, raising the worry that the young people simply wanted to ban all guns.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAs a moderate, I\u2019m like, \u2018Hmmm, are they really just pushing for one type of gun to be banned, or are they pushing for everything?\u2019\u201d Mr. Mason said. \u201cThe protesters are not talking to me. I don\u2019t think they believe that there are people like me out there.\u201d","4":"NASHVILLE \u2014 There is something fundamentally democratic about a Waffle House restaurant in the wee hours of the morning. It\u2019s a place where people working the late shift can stop for a hot meal on the way home, where high school kids can extend prom night just an hour longer, where 20-somethings jazzed on live music can wind down after a night on the town. The coffee is always fresh, and the counter staff has heard it all before but will usually listen again if you need an ear. It\u2019s a uniquely American place.\n\nThere\u2019s something tragically, fundamentally American, too, about an angry young white man with a firearm killing a bunch of strangers who have done him no harm. That\u2019s what happened early Sunday morning, when a man who was naked except for a green jacket loaded with ammunition opened fire with an AR-15 rifle at a Waffle House in the Antioch section of Nashville. Four people were fatally shot and four others were wounded before James Shaw Jr., an unarmed customer, wrestled the gun from him, saving untold lives.\n\nThe attacker ran away, shedding the jacket as he fled. Also left in his wake: Akilah Dasilva, DeEbony Groves, Joe Perez, and Taurean C. Sanderlin, all dead. All were in their 20s. All were people of color.\n\nA search of the truck the gunman left behind led investigators to Travis Reinking, an Illinois man who had moved to Nashville only last fall. Considered armed and dangerous, Mr. Reinking immediately went to the top of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation\u2019s most-wanted list. After some 34 hours at large in a cold rain, he was apprehended Monday afternoon clothed and wearing a backpack containing a loaded semiautomatic handgun.","5":"Tragedy struck the Antioch neighborhood of Nashville early Sunday morning when an armed man shot two individuals outside of a Waffle House before proceeding inside and killing two more.\n\nIn the face of that horror, reports the Tennessean, one Waffle House customer, 29-year-old James Shaw Jr., managed to wrestle an AR-15 rifle free from the shooter and likely saved lives in the process.\n\nNow, although Shaw is quick to brush the claim aside, he is being hailed as a hero.\n\nJames Shaw Jr. was identified as the hero who helped stop the Waffle House shooter this morning. He says he doesn\u2019t feel like a hero, which is exactly what you\u2019d expect a real hero to say. https:\/\/t.co\/0N08omw80u \u2014 Jon Henshaw (@henshaw) April 22, 2018\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know, when everyone said that (of being a hero), it feels selfish,\u201d the Tennessean reports Shaw as saying. \u201cI was just trying to get myself out.

Well, almost.\n\nOn Wednesday, Google rolled out an Android update for the emoji keyboard that replaces the gun emoji with a \"toy water pistol.\" And according to Emojipedia, a similar change is imminent on Facebook.\n\nSEE ALSO: Apple is replacing the pistol emoji with a bright green squirt gun\n\nApple (via Unicode), Samsung, Twitter, and WhatsApp for Android have also all previously replaced guns with toy water pistols.\n\nEmojipedia reports that in the past, Google hedged on the change. But it has also emphasized its desire to be consistent with other platforms. That \"consistency\" is surely what drove this change \u2014 definitely not the gun control movement which has literally taken over the country in the wake of February's Parkland, FL shooting.\n\nIn 2016 when I asked if Google planned to change their gun emoji to a water pistol, the answer was \"we'll see\". Implied: we'll change ours, if or when others change theirs. And now they have. https:\/\/t.co\/lKzrMoSNys pic.twitter.com\/KGTlFLmOn9 \u2014 Jeremy Burge (@jeremyburge) April 24, 2018\n\nGoogle and Facebook's switch leaves one major player still with a straightforward, and not \"playful\" gun emoji option. That's Microsoft, on its Windows devices. Interestingly, though, Microsoft initially had a \"ray gun\" as its gun option. It only switched to a pistol in 2016 \u2014 the same year that Apple opted for a water gun option.\n\nAre toy guns much better tho? Just saying. Image: emojipedia\n\nRidding emoji keyboards of guns may sound like a trivial move in the effort to end gun violence \u2014 and it was a decision that certainly would irked some gun rights advocates. But with emoji more and more defining the way we speak to each other, and with the evidence that words and images impact the way that we actually think and act in the world, taking a gun out of our visual lexicon may be a more powerful act than it seems.","7":"Threatening murder to control your daughter's sex life is soooo funny, right?\n\nOh, wait, no it's not.

But there's also something to be said about the way Feely's \"joke\" denies his daughter's agency \u2014 which is to say, her ability to think and act as a free-thinking human capable of making her own decisions.\n\nThat kind of attitude should (in a just world) be as out of style as, well, treating a deadly weapon as a source of humor.\n\nThe Stoneman Douglas shooting was 2 months ago.\n\n\n\nBut sure, let's make jokes about murdering high schoolers. https:\/\/t.co\/Km3j9G4Ffn \u2014 Geraldine (@everywhereist) April 22, 2018\n\nOh yay - American dads have kicked off the season of \u201clet\u2019s pretend I\u2019m going to shoot my daughter\u2019s date for for impugning her chastity\u201d pics. https:\/\/t.co\/JRkhQTmKRV \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) April 22, 2018\n\nCool to know if your daughter has any self agency you\u2019ll shoot her boyfriend. \u2014 Ally Maynard (@missmayn) April 22, 2018\n\nFeely did tweet out a clarification, noting that it was all just a joke and that he takes \"gun safety seriously\" \u2014 adding that \"I did not intend to be insensitive to that important issue.\"\n\nThe prom picture I posted was obviously intended to be a joke.

Students walked out of classes in March and held rallies across the country later in the month. They say that elected officials have not done enough to prevent school shootings despite a yearslong national debate and the grim roll call of campus killings since Columbine.\n\nShortly before the walkout on Friday began, at 10 a.m., another Florida high school was the site of a shooting when a 19-year-old man entered Forest High School in Ocala and shot a 17-year-old student before being apprehended by an officer stationed at the school.

The system works like this.\n\nAmerica's business interests, upper classes and white population have long made it hard for the poor and working class to register to vote. In most other democracies , voter registration is not the responsibility of individual voters, but is more or less automatic. Unlike these other democracies, US elections are a game of voter turnout, not of substance.\n\nAnd voter turnout efforts are based heavily on money -- big money -- to run ads on TV and other media, buy voter data, manage expensive targeting of households, and other big-ticket strategies. The 2016 federal election cycle saw at least $6.4 billion spent on federal campaigns, and that's not counting the anonymous corporate sums that are not reported.\n\nCongressmen live and breathe for campaign funds, and also to avoid crossing the interests of powerful corporate lobbies that might fund a primary challenger. The result is that billionaires and powerful companies own and operate the US political system. The vulgarity of the US situation would shock Karl Marx, who famously described 19th century democracy as a system in which \"the oppressed are allowed every few years to decide which particular representatives of the oppressing class are to represent and repress them.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Warren to Mulvaney: You're hurting real people Replay More Videos ...

In Citizens United, the Supreme Court basically gutted any control over corruption by eliminating nearly all restrictions on independent campaign spending by corporations, on the grounds that such restrictions violate the \"free speech\" guarantee of the First Amendment.\n\nA system that was already corrupt up to the gills suddenly was essentially told, officially and at the highest level, that American democracy was hereafter being turned over to the highest bidder.

(Reuters) - Demanding an end to gun violence and tougher restrictions on firearm sales, thousands of students again walked out of classes across the United States on Friday in hopes of putting pressure on politicians ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nTimed to coincide with the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre, students left classes at midmorning, many waving placards with slogans including \u201cI should be worried about grades, not guns,\u201d and \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d\n\nOrganizers said students from more than 2,600 schools and institutions were scheduled to take part, but that was fewer than participated in a similar walkout last month. In some places, demonstrators even met with resistance from school administrators.\n\n\u201cToday is about being proactive and being empowered and really funneling all that energy and anger we have as young people into some productive change,\u201d one of the student organizers, Lane Murdock of Connecticut, told Reuters.\n\nOlivia Pfeil, a 16-year-old sophomore from a high school in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, held a sign bearing the names of mass shooting victims. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting change or come next election cycle we will support politicians who are listening to the voices of the youth,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was the second student walkout since the Feb. 14 massacre of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and the emergence of a national student movement to end gun violence and toughen restrictions on firearms sales.\n\nMany of the demonstrators wore orange, a color that has come to represent the movement against gun violence. A 13-second silence was observed in honor of the 13 killed at Columbine.\n\nAt the Texas statehouse in Austin, about 1,000 students, many waving signs and chanting anti-NRA slogans, demanded stricter gun control measures.\n\n\u201cBecause we can\u2019t vote, this is the only way we can make our voices heard,\u201d said Graeclyn Garza, a second-year student at McCallum High School in Austin, who waved a sign reading \u201cEnough.\u201d\n\nOutside the White House, protesters sat in silence while they listened to the names of gun violence victims read aloud.\n\n\u201cIt happened like 20 years ago,\u201d said Ayanna Rhodes, 14, a student at Washington International School, referring to Columbine, \u201cAnd we are still getting mass shootings in schools.\u201d\n\nTwo gunman went on a shooting rampage at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, leaving 12 students and a teacher dead before killing themselves in a massacre that stunned the nation. But since then, school shootings have become commonplace.\n\nEven as students prepared for their protest on Friday morning, news broke that a 17-year-old student had been wounded in a shooting at a high school near Ocala, Florida. A suspect was arrested soon afterward, police said.\n\nThe latest gun violence unfolded about 225 miles (360 km)northwest of the Parkland high school, where two months ago a former student killed 17 people in the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history.\n\nDespite widespread revulsion over the school shootings, the issue of gun control remains sensitive in Colorado and across the country, where the Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms.\n\nStudents gather for a rally in Washington Square Park, as part of a nationwide walk-out of classes to mark the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School mass shooting, in New York City, U.S., April 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\n\n\u2018OPPOSE THEM AT EVERY STEP\u2019\n\nDudley Brown, president of the Colorado-based National Association for Gun Rights, said the gun-control movement seeks to have the government take away constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cThe main objective of these students is to ban firearms completely, and confiscate the firearms of law-abiding Americans,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe will oppose them at every step.\u201d\n\nIn some conservative school districts, administrators told students they could face disciplinary steps if they walked out.\n\nIn suburban Dallas, a dozen students dressed in orange chanted \u201cEnd gun violence!\u201d as they huddled in a parking lot across the street from North Garland High School.\n\nFreshman Victoria Fierro, 14, said school administrators blocked the doors when about 50 students tried to leave, so a small group exited through a side door.\n\n\u201cThey told us we would get in trouble if we walk out, and we told them it was a peaceful protest, we\u2019re not causing any damage,\u201d Fierro said. \u201cThis is over a serious topic that people are pushing aside.\u201d\n\nThe principal declined to answer questions from Reuters.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Friday\u2019s turnout matched those of earlier protests. More than a month ago, tens of thousands of students from some 3,000 schools participated in the #ENOUGH National School Walkout to demand tighter gun control regulations.\n\nOn March 24, \u201cMarch For Our Lives\u201d rallies in cities across the United States were some of the biggest U.S. youth demonstrations in decades, with hundreds of thousands of young Americans and their supporters taking to the streets.\n\nOn the evening before the walk-outs, Colorado gun control activists rallied near Columbine High School.\n\nCarlos Rodriguez, a 17-year-old junior from Marjory Stoneman, traveled to Columbine for the anniversary and said he found a sense of solidarity in the outpouring of support.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s keeping us Douglas students alive right now: the distraction of fighting for our rights and advocating for our lives,\u201d Rodriguez told Reuters.\n\nSlideshow (25 Images)\n\nThere was no walkout on Friday at Columbine, which has not held classes on April 20 since the massacre. Students were encouraged to take part in community service instead.","14":"Data is the new oil. Just as John D Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil swept up the spoils of the \u2013 initially competitive \u2013 oil rush, the future of the internet will be shaped by a handful of tech titans, including Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and their Chinese equivalents Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu. Today, around 90% of internet searches are via Google, and 94% of young people who use social media have a Facebook profile. Just 1% of smartphones use an operating system that isn\u2019t iOS or Android \u2013 made by Apple and Google.\n\nBut the challenge we now face has one key difference to that posed by the oil barons. Rather than price-fixing, many of the tech titans provide a largely \u201cfree\u201d service to the public. Facebook and Google don\u2019t make most of their money through selling services to users, but through advertising. Amazon and Apple, meanwhile, do make money the traditional way, but corner their markets through other means, by squeezing suppliers in the former case or locking in users through software and hardware exclusivity in the latter. So why do these new monopolies pose a problem?\n\nFirstly, because they hold back innovation. By acquiring potential challengers before they become a threat, spending millions lobbying governments to ensure their economic interests are protected, and tying in users through the sheer scale of features and social interaction they offer, the tech giants\u2019 dominant position often leaves entrepreneurs feeling they have no choice but to sell up, or close up. This is bad for innovation and bad for consumer choice \u2013 two things the tech giants once stood for.\n\nVince Cable calls for big internet companies to be broken up - Politics live Read more\n\nIn addition, the tech titans have lost the ability to monitor what content gets put on their own platforms. A small minority of users are posting terrorist propaganda, depictions of child sex abuse, and hate speech. State and non-state actors use these platforms to spread false information and influence elections, including the Brexit referendum and the recent US presidential election. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are either unable or unwilling to curb the misuse of the data they collect, and are increasingly seen as part of the problem.\n\nFinally, the new internet giants operate in a largely borderless world where their main source of profit is intangible intellectual property rather than measurable \u201cthings\u201d. This is difficult to track and quantify, and has turned national tax authorities into largely powerless bystanders.\n\nOf course, any new technology is open to abuse, and the internet has also been an outstanding force for good in its short history. It has empowered activists and investigative journalists in fighting for democracy and exposing corruption, and amplified important campaigns like the #MeToo movement and recent anti-gun marches in the United States.\n\nBut we stand at a crossroads. One way leads to monopoly and abuse. The other way continues the road to empowerment and liberation.\n\nHow should we respond? As liberals we must show that to be radical in this field is not to be statist. We do not accept a Hobson\u2019s choice between the entrenched private monopolies which are becoming the status quo, or direct state control over the internet, as is being developed in China. First, we must revive the trust-busting spirit of previous generations. Competition authorities should be primarily concerned with takeovers which stifle innovation or involve the acquisition of large quantities of valuable data. More radically, companies should be broken up when their size becomes economically detrimental.\n\nOne could imagine Amazon being split into three separate businesses: one offering cloud computing, one acting as a general retailer and one offering a third-party marketplace. Facebook could be made to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp, Google could divest itself of YouTube \u2013 in the process creating new competitors for themselves.\n\nSecond, internet companies should be held accountable for extreme content posted on their platforms through the establishment of a new independent standards body governing the handling of such content. This would put an end to the current \u201cwild west\u201d approach of self-regulation and haphazard government responses to tech-company failures. This is preferable to the draconian system recently put in place by Germany, which has already led to excessive censorship by private companies and a backlog of court appeals and disputes.\n\nThird, concerns over the manipulation of data can be met in part through greater transparency, requiring search algorithms to be made available to the authorities and by requiring commercially used databases to be available for a variety of uses. Such principles become even more important as the data giants develop the use of AI, where there is even more potential for monopoly abuse and manipulation.\n\nFinally, we must entrench and expand the rights of people to own their personal data. The EU\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation is a big step forward in this direction, but it clearly needs to be tested in practice. And it is just the beginning, not the end of the story. We should seriously consider the possibility of compensating people \u2013 or society more broadly \u2013 financially for the data they currently hand over for nothing.\n\nA radical proposal to keep your personal data safe | Richard Stallman Read more\n\nAll four of these suggestions require Britain to be a truly global nation, leading these debates rather than following on the coat-tails of others. The UK cannot do this alone. It will require a regulatory authority with far more clout. How tragic then, that the most effective competition authority in the capitalist world \u2013 one that has already fined Google \u20ac2.4bn for market abuse \u2013 is the European commission. As the world grows closer together, Britain commits an act of serious self-harm by doggedly setting itself apart from the power of shared sovereignty with our neighbours.\n\nWhen it comes to regulating the new oil \u2013 data \u2013 Brexit is the equivalent of giving up shared influence over where, when and whether it rains, in return for absolute power over a compact umbrella.\n\n\u2022 Vince Cable is leader of the Liberal Democrats and former secretary of state for business","15":"There was a time when, even if we disagreed about the remedy, we did at least agree that the patient was sick. We might argue about the meaning of this or that event, but all sides usually accepted that the event in question had at least happened. No longer. A new and unsettling dimension has entered our collective, and global, conversation.\n\nHow Syria's White Helmets became victims of an online propaganda machine Read more\n\nIn the US James Comey, the former FBI director sacked by Donald Trump, released his memoirs and did a round of TV interviews. The FBI has not always enjoyed or deserved public trust \u2013 under its founder, the bigoted and brutal J Edgar Hoover, minorities and trade unionists had good reason to fear it \u2013 but in recent decades it came to be seen as one of the trusted arbiters of American life, a non-partisan referee whose word would be accepted. That would be truer still of the figure at the helm, the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer.\n\nNow, of course it\u2019s natural that Comey\u2019s book would not be hailed as a definitive, objective account of recent, highly contested events. It was not sworn testimony, but an autobiography with all the self-flattery and exculpation associated with that genre. But what was striking was the casual dismissal even of the facts in the book. Trump and the Republican party instantly trashed the ex-director \u2013 himself a Republican \u2013 launching a website: lyincomey.com. You can argue about Comey\u2019s judgment and his self-righteousness \u2013 which make parts of the book read like reflections of The Simpsons\u2019 Ned Flanders \u2013 but his opponents go further, waving aside even that which is verifiably true.\n\nThe more egregious example is also the more serious. At a concert in Barcelona, the former Pink Floyd star Roger Waters accused the Syria Civil Defence, or White Helmets \u2013 the volunteers who pull survivors from the rubble of bomb attacks, and are widely credited with saving thousands of civilian lives \u2013 of being \u201ca fake organisation that exists only to create propaganda for the jihadists and terrorists\u201d.\n\nThat claim, which has been repeatedly debunked, was instantly applauded and spread by the same crowd of pro-Russia voices on the far left and far right who have served so dutifully as Assad\u2019s online cheerleaders. To them, Waters was a hero for daring to speak an unpopular truth. For everyone else, a once admired musician had joined the ranks of conspiracist cranks and apologists for a murderous dictator.\n\nThe remark by Waters fitted a story the Assad denialists have been telling for a while: that the chemical attack in Douma was fake, staged by the White Helmets and their western friends. Russian state TV even aired footage that, it claimed, showed a film set where such atrocities are cooked up. (The pictures were, in fact, taken from the set of a Syrian feature film.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The former Pink Floyd star Roger Waters accused the White Helmets of being \u201ca fake organisation that exists only to create propaganda for the jihadists and terrorists\u201d. Photograph: Pacific Press \/ Barcroft Images\n\nRemember, these voices are not simply saying western air strikes were the wrong response to the killings in Douma. They are saying there were no killings in Douma. Or there were, but they didn\u2019t involve chemical weapons. Or they did, but rebel groups were responsible. Or the whole thing was staged by Britain. The line changes with dizzying frequency.\n\nThe point is, whether it\u2019s Comey or Syria, we are now in an era when the argument is no longer over our response to events, but the very existence of those events. It was the same story after the mass school shooting at Parkland, Florida, in February. A loud chorus of rightists was not content merely to denounce proposed gun control measures: they claimed the massacre had not happened at all, and that all those grieving parents and teenagers were \u201ccrisis actors\u201d.\n\nThese are symptoms of a post-truth disease that\u2019s come to be known as \u201ctribal epistemology\u201d, in which the truth or falsity of a statement depends on whether the person making it is deemed one of us or one of them. According to the writer David Roberts, \u201cinformation is evaluated based not on conformity to common standards of evidence or correspondence to a common understanding of the world, but on whether it supports the tribe\u2019s values and goals and is vouchsafed by tribal leaders. \u2018Good for our side\u2019 and \u2018true\u2019 begin to blur into one.\u201d\n\nOf course, we all suffer from confirmation bias, and all of us listen more to our friends than to our foes \u2013 but this goes further. Recall the Trump spokesperson Scottie Nell Hughes, who declared: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing, unfortunately, any more as facts.\u201d For many Americans, Hughes explained, Trump\u2019s tweets, regardless of the evidence, \u201care truth\u201d simply because they come from him.\n\nIt fits that social media is the weapon of choice. Its algorithms are proven to favour virality over veracity, spreading false stories faster and wider than true ones. A mysterious pro-Assad tweeter, with no other traceable existence online, has nearly as many followers as the BBC\u2019s Middle East editor. Meanwhile, the top story on Google News the morning after the US presidential election hailed Trump as the winner of the popular vote \u2013 even though he had lost it by nearly 3m votes. The tribe tells itself what it wants to hear.\n\nThe desire to stand with your fellow Republicans or Assad apologists is so great you\u2019re ready to throw out not only your opponents\u2019 arguments but their evidence too. And because trust in all the previously respected referees \u2013 from the media to human rights organisations to the FBI \u2013 has collapsed, you refuse to believe anything and anyone that contradicts you.\n\nThe danger this poses is clear. Comey\u2019s moment will pass, but eventually his predecessor at the FBI, special counsel Robert Mueller, will deliver his report into the Trump campaign\u2019s alleged collusion with Russia. Already Trump\u2019s Fox News outriders are trashing Mueller \u2013 another Republican-appointed straight arrow whose honesty has never been credibly questioned \u2013 branding him biased, corrupt, even \u201cthe head of a crime family\u201d. That will make it easier to ignore his findings, however damning. If Richard Nixon were in office now, even Watergate would not be Watergate: his own tribe would simply dismiss the hard, factual evidence against him.\n\nIf Nixon were in office now, Watergate would not be Watergate: his tribe would simply dismiss the hard evidence\n\nAs for Syria, Waters and the rest may seem like fringe voices, but such thinking eventually leaks into the mainstream. On yesterday\u2019s Question Time, Emily Thornberry echoed the Russian claim that chemical weapons inspectors were being kept out of Douma by UN red tape and health and safety rules \u2013 when in fact it is Assad and Russia keeping them out: long enough, presumably, to ensure that by the time they\u2019re granted access the crucial evidence will have been cleared away.\n\nIt makes for a chilling landscape, a world where atrocities are committed twice over \u2013 once when they are done, and again when they are denied. Not decades later, but even as the dead are still being buried. The great division of our time may not, after all, be between left and right or open and closed, but something more fundamental still: between what is true and what is false.\n\n\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist","16":"When I meet Amy Schumer, she has been married for exactly one month and is working on a joke about her husband\u2019s penis. Something along the lines of, my husband is uncircumcised \u2013 for now. She had jotted it down on the Notes app on her iPhone, where she keeps a lot of ideas, but it duplicated the note five times \u201cso now it looks like I really have plans to mutilate him,\u201d she says.\n\nShe then admits that she actually first used that line about another man she used to date, \u201cbut you have to update it so it\u2019s about the person you\u2019re with now. And really, my husband is good, he can keep everything he has. At this point in my life, I\u2019m cool with foreskin or not \u2013 God bless everyone and their penii,\u201d she says, breezily, as if she might have exhausted herself by creating a persona who is supposed to care so much.\n\nI think we should see more \u2013 I\u2019m not letting them retouch me in the film\n\nAmy Schumer is a conundrum. A native New Yorker, she made her incredibly successful name doing stand-up comedy about raw, rude sex and all of its discontents, about dating and dirtiness and blacking out drunk and doing the walk of shame home. Her TV sketch show, Inside Amy Schumer, ran for four series on Comedy Central and often mercilessly skewered the gender hypocrisy of what our culture allows men and women to do, in particular the beauty myths that silently surround women, in sketches such as \u201cGirl You Don\u2019t Need Makeup\u201d and \u201cHer Last Fuckable Day\u201d.\n\nAt the Glamour awards in London in 2015, after various female celebrities had tottered up to the stage to receive awards in heels they could barely walk in and dresses they could barely breathe in, Schumer strode on. \u201cI\u2019m probably 160lb right now,\u201d she said, looking out over the audience with disdain, \u201cand I can catch a dick whenever I want. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d I was there; she changed the mood of the room from faux modesty to explosive, spluttering laughter, and all the disdained women ran up to her afterwards, desperate to be her friend. It felt like a tipping point in that industry; famous women have been letting their guard down ever since.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stealing the show: Amy Schumer after bringing the house down at the Glamour awards. Photograph: David M Benett\/Getty Images\n\nYet a couple of months later, her debut movie Trainwreck came out, which she wrote and starred in. It began promisingly and originally, but ended with her character giving up her competitive career and literally becoming a cheerleader \u2013 an actual cheerleader \u2013 for her clever, high-achieving man. The next year Schumer published her autobiography, The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo, in which, alongside stories of a childhood going from riches to rags on Long Island with her dad\u2019s dodgy business skills and then illness, and both her parents\u2019 philandering, she wrote that, actually, she had only ever had a one-night stand once, and it was lovely and respectful, thank you very much.\n\nNow she has made I Feel Pretty, a film about a woman who gets a bash on the head and wrongly believes herself to have become as beautiful as a supermodel, and so creates a whole new life for her sexy self. The film asks if beauty is a state of mind \u2013 while also involving Schumeresque motifs such as a vaginal injury on an exercise bike.\n\nMeanwhile, Schumer has surprised the gossip papers by suddenly getting married, to a chef called Chris Fischer, in a lacy white wedding dress on a clifftop in Malibu. For celebrities, this is as traditional as your father walking you down the aisle in your village church. Coverage of the wedding made it all sound rather giddy and impulsive, but when I ask her about it, she is anything but.\n\n\u201cI feel exactly the same as before I was married \u2013 but I\u2019m psyched. I love him,\u201d she says, her face deadly serious, like she\u2019s been through a thing or two in this life. \u201cLike, I\u2019m fucking \u2013 it feels like having a partner. It feels like not being alone.\u201d We are sitting in a rather fancy hotel suite overlooking Central Park, where Schumer is promoting her new movie. Her bodyguard is in the next room, along with two assistants who have taken Schumer\u2019s tiny black poodle Tatiana, who was barking too much for the interview. \u201cHe\u2019s 38, I\u2019m 36, so, you know, we are not completing each other. We already are who we are and just want to support and encourage each other. And so I\u2019m psyched that I don\u2019t have to be zipping up my knee boots, leaving someone\u2019s apartment at 3am. I\u2019m done.\u201d She says this wasn\u2019t like other relationships, \u201cwhere you\u2019re like, come on, pleeease meet my parents. I can\u2019t believe I dealt with any of that bullshit before! This was like, oh my God I fucking love this person, and I admire him, and we\u2019re a team and he was ready.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I don\u2019t think of this movie as a love story.

In fact, she looks baffled by quite a few of my questions: interviews are clearly not her favourite thing. I want to discuss her work being about the concept of fuckability, but she says that that\u2019s not accurate, and turns her nose up a bit.\n\nShe says this film is about her character Renee simply wanting to be seen, and though there\u2019s a boyfriend angle, \u201cI don\u2019t think of this movie as a love story. It\u2019s about her and her friends.\u201d She says the dressing-up is for other women, because she has learned, with age, that we don\u2019t really dress for men. \u201cIn my experience, men are not that psyched and the guys that I\u2019m attracted to aren\u2019t the guys who are like, \u2018Oh, is that the new Givenchy line?\u2019 I think, her thing is about confidence and about feeling attractive.\u201d\n\nWhat the kids are just realising is that the adults are not actually in control\n\nWell, yes and no. I mean if it\u2019s all about women, then her character entering a bikini competition and shaking her stuff all over the stage in a dive bar full of men does seem an interesting move. Yet the thing about the bikini scene is \u2013 it becomes lovely. You start watching it behind your hands, cringing \u2013 and by the end you\u2019re charmed by the sight of someone just thoroughly, unabashedly enjoying herself.\n\nSchumer is glad I liked that scene, and says she fought for it. She was supposed to just stand there, \u201cbut I said no, I\u2019m going to go nuts on stage, I\u2019m going to dump water on myself, do the whole thing. And I seriously fought everybody and I\u2019m so glad I did.\u201d She also has a sex scene, and fought to be allowed to reveal more flesh but still have the film rated 13. \u201cI think we should see more, you know, and I\u2019m not letting them retouch any of me in the movie.\u201d\n\nThere is an idiosyncratic, pioneering power to Schumer\u2019s comedy work that I keep looking for in her films. They veer towards slapstick whereas her solo material has brains and guts. I do not make myself popular by suggesting this, and Schumer bristles when I ask what sort of movies she would make if there was no financial compulsion for feelgood endings.\n\n\u201cYou know, I said no to a movie where I would have made five times this amount of money,\u201d she says. Really? Someone else\u2019s project? \u201cMmm,\u201d she replies, mysteriously. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not so much about the money. Like, I wouldn\u2019t want to spend three years of my life working on The Revenant. I filmed a drama two years ago and it was a bummer. I don\u2019t want to show people what I can do \u2013 I just want to do stuff that will make people feel better.\u201d\n\nHot women, once the butt of her jokes, now get cast in her films. I Feel Pretty co-stars Emily Ratajkowski, who rose to fame dancing topless in the Blurred Lines music video, and also features a cameo from Naomi Campbell. \u201cI did a lot of press yesterday sitting next to Emily and I think that probably would have been kind of hard for me 10 years ago,\u201d she admits. They were wearing similar clothes, \u201cand I would have made a joke about it before \u2013 but now it\u2019s just \u2013 I just feel like that\u2019s over. I kind of feel done with the self-ranking thing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Black humour: Schumer\u2019s The Leather Special. Photograph: Marcus Price\/Netflix\n\nShe says this comes from growing up and realising that she feels most beautiful when she\u2019s away with her girls, or on a night out where she\u2019s just \u201cso happy, so comfortable, you know who you are. And then it\u2019s like, well, why can\u2019t we just feel like that all the time?\u201d One of those girls is her best buddy Jennifer Lawrence. \u201cI texted her yesterday and I was like, \u2018I did an interview today and I told them you were really hideous up close.\u2019 And she wrote, \u2018Actual LOL\u2019, and then she added in parenthesis \u2018(Because I\u2019m so pretty, you know?)\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Exactly.\u2019\u201d I ask about their shared sense of humour. \u201cWell, Jen\u2019s quick. She picks up on things that I just mutter to make myself laugh. I\u2019ll just say something under my breath, and she\u2019ll be like, \u2018I heard that.\u2019\u201d\n\nSpeaking of comic actors, Michelle Williams is an absolute revelation in I Feel Pretty. It\u2019s perhaps the biggest shock of the film. \u201cMe too,\u201d says Schumer. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she was really funny. Like she\u2019s really funny. Why didn\u2019t we know? It\u2019s because they always put her in some awful thing where she\u2019s got to be on the floor, crying.\u201d\n\nAs for the #MeToo movement, Schumer wholly supports it but isn\u2019t jumping up and down whooping about it \u201cbecause, while it\u2019s exciting, it\u2019s also really triggering and upsetting. It makes everybody feel super vulnerable. But to think that this generation is going to say, \u2018This isn\u2019t acceptable,\u2019 and not just bury the things that our mothers buried \u2013 that feels really good. It feels like, across the board, we\u2019re getting closer to equality. Which is \u2013 it\u2019s such a gut-wrenching thing to even have to say that.\u201d\n\nShe must have seen a few of her own male colleagues in comedy go down. \u201cRight, there are people you love that can have really shitty behaviour that needs to be called out. And then there are so many men who are just scared, they\u2019re just waiting for the phone to ring, they\u2019re waiting to open their computer and see their faces and it\u2019s a frightening time for them. But then we\u2019re going, \u2018We\u2019ve been frightened our whole lives.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Show of strength: on the Women\u2019s March in 2017 with Madonna. Photograph: Kevin Mazur\/WireImage\n\nAs for the future, Schumer continues to campaign for gun control, aided by her distant cousin the US senator Chuck Schumer, and to call out certain other senators and their links to the NRA. It\u2019s a subject even closer to her heart after two young women were shot in an American cinema while watching her movie Trainwreck. The day we meet, schoolkids are pouring out of their classrooms across the USA to demonstrate, \u201cand I think once I start looking at that news footage I\u2019ll just be crying all day,\u201d she says. We discuss the Florida survivors, such as Emma Gonzalez. \u201cThese kids are really making an impact and I feel more hopeful right now than I thought possible,\u201d she says. \u201cThis has been more movement than I thought that I would see in my lifetime. I think what they\u2019re just realising is that the adults are not actually in control.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also time for a change in Schumer\u2019s own life. I ask about a typical day for her and she says that for the past 10 years, from the moment she woke up till she went to sleep, \u201cI was driven and working and writing. Doing stand-up, you know, promoting something or filming something. I would say that, for 15 years, I was getting up at seven, going boxing, showering, going to the writer\u2019s room all day, and having an interview during lunch. Afterward, maybe getting some sort of acupuncture before going and doing stand-up, and then having, like, 90 minutes when I could write when I got home. You know? That\u2019s been it. I\u2019ve been hustling for so long, I want to take care of myself now. I got really sick and it just made me realise I wasn\u2019t invincible. I need to slow down.\u201d\n\nOne last thing though \u2013 can we just clear up the one-night-stand thing? Do you really mean you only had sex within relationships? \u201cNo! See to me, a one-night stand is where you meet someone that same day, you have sex with them, and then you never see them again. Sleeping with a friend or having sex with someone you know just once, no, I don\u2019t consider that a one-night stand. I should make an addendum to that book. Something else I realised: I wrote that I don\u2019t like watercress in the book. But I meant water chestnuts. So I need to publish two corrections, I guess.\u201d\n\nI Feel Pretty is in cinemas in the UK and Ireland on 4 May","17":"There is nothing out of the ordinary about a book that makes one angry. We have all read ones that provoke us, and the internet is an inexhaustible feast for anyone easily outraged. It is unusual, however, to read a book that makes one mad with oneself.\n\nThe co-authors of New Power could not be more likable. Clever, witty and creative, Henry Timms and Jeremy Heimans are baby-faced wunderkinds of digital activism; the type whose optimistic energy ought to make one feel hopeful for the future. So it is uncomfortable to confess that I hated almost every word, and wished more than anything for them to be wrong. The reason their book made me so cross with myself was that, if they are right, it means my way of thinking is old-fashioned and elitist \u2013 the very problem, in fact, they are trying to solve.\n\nNew Power begins by contrasting a 20th-century model of power \u2013 \u201cjealously guarded, closed, inaccessible and leader-driven\u201d, typified by Harvey Weinstein \u2013 with a new 21st-century model \u2013 \u201copen, participatory peer-driven\u201d, exemplified by the #MeToo movement. No political or commercial organisation will survive, it argues, unless it abandons \u201cold power values\u201d of expertise, confidentiality, formal governance and managerialism, and adopts \u201cnew power values\u201d of online crowd-sourcing, radical transparency, leaderless structures and amateurish enthusiasm. The future belongs to Airbnb and Black Lives Matter, in other words, and the book is a manual for us to learn how to be more like them.\n\nHeimans is Australian, but has just flown in from the US hours before we meet; Timms is British, but based in New York, so takes part by phone. Heimans is 40, but looks as if he is in his early 20s, and we spend the first five minutes discussing his skin-care regime. He indulges my curiosity about moisturiser choices with self-deprecating humour, but small talk doesn\u2019t feel like his natural register, and the purpose of the book is deadly serious. \u201cThe future,\u201d it predicts, \u201cwill be won by those who can spread their ideas better, faster and more durably.\u201d In 2018, as Heimans says, \u201cIt\u2019s really hard not to make the argument that the forces of misinformation and extremism and nativism are in the lead.\u201d\n\nHe invites us to contrast the success of the new power recruitment strategy of Isis with the failure of the US state department\u2019s old power effort to thwart it; Isis recruits through a peer-to-peer network of youngsters sharing seductive intimacies on social media, which the state department sought to defeat with a calamitously ill-judged Twitter account bearing an image of its official seal and the instruction: \u201cThink Again, Turn Away!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is really the reason why we wrote the book, and why we made the book quite practical,\u201d Heimans says. \u201cBecause we want these tools to be in the hands of those on the side of the angels.\u201d Timms agrees: \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a lot of people \u2013 the scientists, the community organisers, the people who believe in enlightenment values \u2013 to embrace the new power tools and get really good at being powerful.\u201d Their problem, of course, is that this target audience can be as sniffy about it as me.\n\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s this emotional resistance,\u201d Heimans reflects equably, trying, I think, to conceal his impatience with it. \u201cThere\u2019s a complacency on the liberal side: \u2018Why should we have to do this? Why should we get our hands dirty? Who needs a meme when you have a fact?\u2019\u201d That pretty much sums me up, I cheerfully admit. If others want to spend their time sharing amusing video clips on Twitter, they are welcome to, but why do I have to get involved? The question is semi-ironic; his reply is arrestingly earnest.\n\n\u201cThe moral argument is, Decca, you care about these values that the newspaper you work for stands for, and we all have an obligation to learn these skills of building movements, spreading ideas, figuring out how to manage these communities.\u201d\n\nThe case he and Timms make for the superiority of social media-driven, open, mass participatory movements, loosely structured but cleverly engineered for loyalty, is unarguable. By deploying new power tactics, organisations as diverse as Ted talks, Pope Francis\u2019s Vatican and the National Rifle Association are thriving, whereas Uber \u2013 which treats its drivers with contempt \u2013 is in trouble. This doesn\u2019t, however, alter my problem with the fact that the stunts that capture attention in the new power model are often toe-curlingly inane.\n\nGormless frat-boy humour doesn\u2019t, curiously, appear to trouble Heimans. He is a huge admirer of the Ice Bucket Challenge, which raised more than $115m (\u00a382m) for charity in 2015. Then there is Reddit, whose highest-scoring post ever at one point was a message titled: \u201ctest post please ignore\u201d, provoking what Heimans calls the \u201crebellious\u201d instincts of the Reddit community, and others might call asinine. In 2016, the Natural Environment Research Council experimented with new power by launching a #NameOurShip social media campaign. When some bright spark proposed Boaty McBoatface, \u201cthe internet,\u201d note Heimans and Timms, apparently amused, \u201cof course agreed.\u201d I am relieved when Heimans tells me he would not have voted for Boaty himself \u2013 but less so when he adds that he would have gone for the popular alternative option, \u201cI Like Big Boats and I Cannot Lie\u201d. Public subversion sabotaged the campaign because the NERC, the argument goes, was a new power amateur. Nevertheless, its decision to overrule the Boaty vote and call the ship the RSS David Attenborough instead was, Heimans maintains, a mistake.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got this really dull research vessel that no one would have paid any attention to, at a time when we\u2019re trying to get people enthusiastic about science, at a time when the anti-science crowd is gaining potency. You could have had a crowd of people follow Boaty McBoatface on its journey. You could have had people help fund it. You could have had people engaged as citizen scientists. You could have created a whole community around that work that would have put people into the funnel of creating some intensity around science. Why wouldn\u2019t you do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s moronic!\u201d I want to say \u2013 but am embarrassed by how stiff and snooty I sound. Heimans and Timms make me feel as if I have turned into Jacob Rees-Mogg. There is nothing snobbish about the next misgiving I raise. At the heart of every successful new power platform are what Heimans and Timms call \u201cfeedback loops\u201d \u2013 reward systems of likes, shares and comments engineered to keep us coming back, craving the next dopamine hit of external validation. That this buzz is addictive is obvious; the authors\u2019 assertion that likes on Instagram \u201caren\u2019t (just) ego boosts\u201d, however, sounds laughably delusional. What other possible function can \u201cLooking gorge, babe!!\u201d serve? Has Timms, I joke, not seen Instagram?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Henry Timms: \u2018Elitists will still have a role\u2019\n\n\u201cWe are not here to defend the culture of narcissistic selfies,\u201d he says. \u201cNo. We want a healthcare system that works. We want a government that people actually like. We want an education system that gives people a sense of connection. The problem is most of those institutions were created in an old power context. They were built for the 20th century, and sometimes the 19th century, and so we have to start reimagining those institutions so that they don\u2019t fail. You think about a millennial person whose life is full of these feedback loops \u2013 a lot of their life is mediated through these new power platforms, right. That\u2019s what they want from their institutions now.\u201d\n\nBut the authors never mention the growing evidence of the psychological damage feedback loops are doing to young people\u2019s mental health. If millennials are addicted to loops, of course they will want more \u2013 but if the relentless judging and ranking is making them ill, the state doesn\u2019t have to oblige, does it?\n\n\u201cI think mental health is a real concern,\u201d Timms acknowledges. \u201cBut I think the really huge risk is the damage of distraction. We are all so engaged in our participation \u2013 but it distracts us from the things that matter. If feedback loops are only built around cat videos, that\u2019s clearly a distraction. That\u2019s clearly going to distract us from the things that matter the most.\u201d\n\nTaxes, for example, matter. \u201cThey\u2019re critical to any society. But as feedback loops go, the system does not perform particularly well. You essentially just give the government money, and have no real sense of where it ends up. Imagine a world where actually you\u2019re getting much better feedback loops around your taxes, so you pay the taxes and you end up in a world where you find out where the money goes. Maybe you have some more power over how it\u2019s spent. Maybe you hear about the impact along the way.\u201d\n\nThe possibility that anyone might not want this appears not to have crossed Timms\u2019 mind. Personally, I don\u2019t want a feedback loop with HMRC. But as I don\u2019t want to share a meme, upload a video or name a boat either, to infer a contemporary trend from my preferences might be absurd. What is less clear, but more important, is whether Timms and Heimans\u2019 temperamental bias similarly distorts their work on new power. Their authorial voice is reporterly, but the affectation of clear-eyed critical distance is misleading, for both are key protagonists in the new power movements they write about. It is hard, therefore, to know whether the power of the new power they report is objectively real, or just wishful thinking.\n\nThe son of immigrants, by the age of 12 Heimans was already a precocious political pundit on national Australian TV. At 27, he founded a grassroots movement called GetUp!, which, according to their book, now has more members than every political party in Australia combined. He is also the founder and CEO of Purpose.org, an international activist organisation incubating political campaigns worldwide. Timms is the director of 92Y, a cultural centre in New York, and in 2012 founded a philanthropic movement called #GivingTuesday that brings new power tactics to the old challenge of fundraising. They are evangelical pioneers in the world they describe in their book, and I wonder whether this makes them more cheerleaders than observers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re optimists,\u201d Heimans concedes. \u201cWe do believe that there are inherent benefits to participation, if done well and smartly.\u201d He would still have written exactly the same book, however, if he shared all my misgivings. \u201cWe\u2019re very invested in getting this right, because we have to be, because the old world isn\u2019t coming back. Like it or not, it\u2019s just not coming back.\u201d\n\nBoth men see plenty of problems with the new world. Facebook comes out of their book very badly, accused of co-opting the rhetoric of new power while behaving more like the Kremlin. Writing long before the Cambridge Analytica revelations, they predict that \u201cParticipation farms\u201d, which harvest our data for profit, will have to be tackled. Politicians such as Donald Trump, who deploy the power of social media for authoritarian ambitions, pose a grave danger, they warn, and leaderless new power movements such as Occupy can unravel into chaos. The Parkland students in Florida campaigning for gun control \u201cget it,\u201d Heimans says. \u201cThey know how to harness the energy of a connected crowd.\u201d To succeed, however, they will need to partner with old power. Hashtags and marches won\u2019t do it alone. \u201cOur argument,\u201d explains Heimans, \u201cis not: \u2018Throw away these old power skills that you\u2019ve learned, the expertise, the understanding of how to navigate traditional organisational structures.\u2019 We all still need those skills. The key is learning how and when to use old and new.\u201d\n\nI think Timms might be trying to cheer me up when he agrees. \u201cElitists will still have a role. They will still be needed.\u201d After all, he jokes, he had his appendix out a month ago. \u201cAnd no one wants a group of hipster makers to crowdsource an appendectomy, right? No one wants that.\u201d\n\nNew Power by Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms is published by Macmillan, price \u00a320. To order a copy for \u00a317, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Their bid to effect peaceful change is arguably one of the great \u2018what if?\u2019 moments in Irish history, now remembered in a new exhibtion\n\nWhen did the Troubles begin? Was it when the first stone was thrown or the first shot fired? Or did they begin earlier with a police baton blow? Or earlier still with a peaceful march demanding civil rights? As with almost anything to do with Northern Ireland\u2019s turbulent political past, the moment is contested. For me, they began on 30 November 1968, when, as a young lad, I attended a civil rights march in my home town, Armagh.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (Nicra) had been formed the year before by a broad coalition \u2013 trade unionists, radical socialists, republicans and members of the Northern Irish Labour and Liberal parties \u2013 with the same basic aim: to challenge anti-Catholic discrimination in jobs and housing. One of its defining slogans was the now quaintly sexist \u201cOne man, one vote\u201d, which demanded an end to the system of plural voting that prevailed in Northern Ireland long after it had been abolished in the rest of the UK. To be eligible to vote in a local election in Northern Ireland you had to be a homeowner, most of whom were middle- and upper-class Protestants. Many of them were business owners, which entitled them to several extra votes.\n\nTo make matters worse, the state also employed gerrymandering (manipulating ward boundaries in local elections to maintain a false unionist majority). This meant that in 1968 in predominantly Catholic Derry, where the total nationalist vote was 14,000 and the unionist vote 9,000, the local council comprised 12 unionist and eight nationalist members. Since its inception in 1921, when Ireland was partitioned, Northern Ireland, though remaining part of the UK, was a place apart. One of its founders, Lord Craigavon, had promised \u201ca Protestant parliament for a Protestant people\u201d. Four decades later, the state was essentially and unapologetically biased in favour of its majority population in terms of the allocation of council houses and jobs.\n\nWhen we saw police laying into marchers, it was as if something hidden and hateful had been pushed into the open Rory McShane, civil rights activist\n\nFor the majority of working-class Catholics who took to the streets in support of civil rights, the cause was personal as well as political. After they married, my parents were on a council house waiting list for 13 years, living for most of that time with my maternal grandparents. For that period and longer, neither of them had a vote in a local election. As with many of their generation, the civil rights protests signalled to them an end to the soul-sapping collective acquiescence that had prevailed in the province for so long, and led to an embrace of a late-flowering activism that was profoundly empowering.\n\nI remember the day of the Armagh march well: the almost carnival atmosphere as the marchers, several thousand strong, set off from the Killylea Road, close to the housing estate I lived on. My parents joined the march, taking my younger brother and sister with them. My grandparents attended, as did most of my relatives and several of my school teachers and fellow pupils from the Christian Brothers\u2019 grammar school. Almost everyone from Catholic housing estates in the town seemed to be there, as well as many prominent middle-class local figures. Protesters came from all over the north, and even from the south. Under the civil rights banner, trade unionists, Labour party members, radical socialists, communists and even anarchists united for a common cause, with ordinary, politically unaffiliated people believing, perhaps for the first time in their lives, that real change was a possibility.\n\nAll this came back to me a few months ago when I was asked by the Gallery of Photography Ireland to put forward an idea for an exhibition. The more I thought about it, the more it seemed crucial to evoke the sense of excitement and empowerment of that lost moment in 1968, before the Troubles reinstated an older narrative of violent Irish republicanism against British colonialism.\n\nFor many people, particularly in England, the Troubles are understood essentially as a war between the IRA, whose aim was to reunite Ireland, and the British security forces. The short-lived civil rights era of the late 60s and early 70s has been conveniently overlooked, perhaps because it illuminates the fact that the endemic discrimination in Northern Ireland was ignored for decades by successive Westminster governments of every political hue. In retrospect, though, it represents one of the great \u201cwhat if?\u201d moments when the violence that followed might have been averted through reform.\n\nI have called the exhibition The Lost Moment (having decided after much deliberation not to place a question mark after the title) and it will open on 28 April in the Nerve Centre in Derry, a gallery housed in the former Ebrington army barracks that looked over the city throughout the Troubles. The show will include work by local and international photographers as well as films, projections and ephemera from the time in the form of political posters, periodicals and pamphlets. It is an attempt to evoke not just the spirit of idealism and protest, but also the anxieties and anger of the unionist counter-demonstrations that sprang up in reaction to it.\n\nOne of the aims of the exhibition is to place the Northern Irish civil rights movement in the context of other protest movements of the time. It was a struggle that adopted the nonviolent tactics espoused by Martin Luther King and his followers in America \u2013 even borrowing their gospel anthem, We Shall Overcome. Like that movement, it was a broad church \u2013 an approach with which its more radical supporters, particularly the young leftwing students who formed the more militant People\u2019s Democracy party in 1968, quickly grew impatient. They looked instead towards the more confrontational actions on the streets of Paris and Chicago during the various revolutionary uprisings of that tumultuous year. Veteran Derry-based leftwing activist and political commentator Eamonn McCann, for instance, had attended the anti-Vietnam war protest in London\u2019s Grosvenor Square in March of that year, which ended in a riot.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The first civil rights march, on 24 August 1968 in Dungannon. Photograph: Belfast Telegraph\n\nHistorian Paul Bew, one of several Protestant leftwing student activists at the time (and later an adviser to the former unionist leader David Trimble) says: \u201cI don\u2019t recall ever having a discussion about the border or the national question with any of the student protest leaders. It was all about Vietnam, Prague, Paris \u2013 those issues cut across the partisan politics of Northern Ireland and fed into the protests there.\u201d One of the student leaders, Michael Farrell, later recalled how a group of activists went straight from an anti-Vietnam war protest outside Belfast city hall to the first civil rights march in Dungannon in August 1968, replacing the slogans on their placards along the way.\n\nThe march from Coalisland to Dungannon on Saturday 24 August 1968 drew 4,000 people, and despite a government ban and a vociferous loyalist counter-demonstration organised by the Rev Ian Paisley, passed off peacefully. McCann and his fellow activists immediately contacted Nicra with a request to hold another march in Derry on Saturday 5 October. At the 11th hour, it was banned by William Craig, the minister for home affairs, after a local loyalist organisation announced that they would hold a march along the same route on the same day.\n\nThe Derry activists decided to go ahead with the protest anyway, hoping their defiance would help attract an even bigger crowd. The ban had the opposite effect and only about 400 assembled at the start point, with another 200 curious onlookers lining the pavements. \u201cIt was a very disappointing crowd,\u201d McCann later concluded. What subsequently happened, though, had a seismic impact way beyond Derry and Northern Ireland.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A poster announcing the Derry march that ended in disaster. Photograph: Nicra \/ Museum of Free Derry\n\nThe march ended almost before it began, when large numbers of Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) employed a tactic that decades later would be known as \u201ckettling\u201d \u2013 hemming in the protesters on Duke Street. Stewards urged the crowd to keep calm, but placards were thrown in frustration. Then all hell broke lose. Gaye O\u2019Brien, a news cameraman from the Irish broadcaster RTE, was on hand to record the RUC\u2019s response. The footage remains viscerally shocking to this day \u2013 baton-wielding officers wading into the crowd, felling young and old alike, cracking skulls as women scream and children scatter. An unsuspecting elderly man is struck from behind across the side of the face. Moments later, a breathless officer batons a marcher to the ground, his face twisted in fury, before he catches sight of the camera that has just captured his violence for posterity.\n\nAmong those who escaped serious injury that day, but underwent a dramatic political epiphany, was a young woman who would soon become one of the key figures in the years of ferment that were to follow. \u201cYou could feel the hatred,\u201d Bernadette Devlin said decades later. \u201cThat\u2019s my recollection of that day. It was my first realisation that the police hated us.\u201d\n\nAcross the nationalist areas of the north, the scenes of police violence provoked a collective howl of anger. \u201cPeople were outraged,\u201d remembers Rory McShane, who in 1968 was president of the students\u2019 union at Queen\u2019s University in Belfast and a prominent civil rights activist. \u201cWhen we saw the police laying into the marchers on the news, it was as if something hidden and hateful had suddenly been pushed out into the open.\u201d\n\nCoverage of the violence achieved more in terms of highlighting the plight of Northern Ireland\u2019s Catholic minority than decades of dogged, but unproductive, campaigning by nationalist politicians. Derry suddenly became synonymous with Selma and the US black civil rights struggle led by the recently murdered Martin Luther King. If, as Devlin later put it, \u201ctelevision brought the world to our doorstep\u201d, it also brought the civil rights cause in Northern Ireland to a global audience. \u201cThe Bogside was deluged with journalists,\u201d recalled McCann. \u201cA journalist from the Daily Mail came to my front door asking for the name and address of an articulate, Catholic, unemployed slum-dweller she could talk to. Derry was big news.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Belfast Telegraph, from November 1968, reports on the violence spiralling out from the Derry march. Photograph: The Belfast Telegraph\n\nThe immediate effect was about 2,000 students organised a march from the university to the city hall in protest at police brutality. They were blocked by the RUC and another counter-demonstration organised by Paisley, who was fast become an imposing and divisive presence in Northern Irish politics. A four-hour sit-down protest ensued.\n\nIt was against this backdrop of protest and counter-protest that the march in Armagh took place. I went to the assembly point early with a couple of friends and we attached ourselves to a group containing some older lads from school. They had congregated beneath a large red-and-black banner, which we soon discovered belonged to a small, but vociferous, local anarchist group. Ahead of them was a much bigger group of young radicals who belonged to the People\u2019s Democracy party. They exuded a collective confidence that was in contrast to the more tentative demeanor of some of the older people there. As we set off towards the centre of town, the crowd sang We Shall Overcome. It is my recollection that the anarchists and student radicals didn\u2019t join in, instead chanting \u201cHo Ho Ho Chi Minh! \u2013 We shall fight and we shall win!\u201d and \u201cTwo, four, six, eight \u2013 organise and smash the state!\u201d It was all very new and exciting, an event of almost epic proportions for those of us who had never witnessed such an energising disruption of the everyday.\n\nOn we went, singing and chanting, until the march came to an abrupt halt. In the ensuing confusion, my friends and I negotiated our way through the throng to the corner of Thomas Street, which led to the town centre. A line of uneasy-looking RUC men stood in front of their vehicles, which blocked the street. Beyond them, at the other end of the street, another row of police was visible, and behind them a huge crowd of union jack-waving loyalists. They were \u201cthe Paisleyites\u201d and they had somehow been allowed to commandeer the centre of town. The protesters were outraged, but the presence of the Paisleyites was not entirely unexpected: rumours had circulated though the Catholic housing estates earlier that a certain Protestant shopkeeper had been seen handing out pickaxe handles to a mob that had arrived in town the night before. There were indeed large sticks being brandished in Market Street alongside the union flags being waved.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Armagh march on 30 November 1968.

An RUC man addressed the crowd who, surprisingly, listened attentively. He assured us that we were not allowed to proceed for our own security, which elicited hoots of jeering laughter. Prominent civil rights figures Ivan Cooper and John Hume cautioned restraint through a crackling megaphone. Their pleas were successful and, after some debate and a few attempts by one boy to scale the police barricade, the marchers turned back, much to the disgust of the young militants.\n\nLater that day, police attacked a crowd of locals who had broken the windows of a departing bus full of Paisleyites. \u201cI vividly remember the RUC arrived and the stewards tried to negotiate with them,\u201d recalls Dermot Kelly, who attended the march as a young People\u2019s Democracy activist. \u201cIt seemed to work, but then the RUC broke though their ranks and started batoning everyone in sight, including the moderators. It was vicious and indiscriminate.\u201d A familiar narrative was being played out: loyalist triumphalism, aggressive policing of the protests, rising frustration among the protesters.\n\nFor days afterwards, the question asked by the nationalist community in Armagh was: what would have happened if a nationalist mob had attempted to take control of the town centre to prevent a loyalist march? It was, of course, a rhetorical question: everyone knew the answer. It was clear too, that a sizable minority of the protesters were growing impatient with the perceived compliance of the civil rights association in the face of the police and loyalist tactics. Where I lived, the middle-class representatives of Nicra were now being referred to derisively as \u201cgreen Tories\u201d.\n\nWhat happened next, as 1968 gave way to 1969, and the schism between the moderates and the militants in the civil rights movement deepened, is viewed by some historians, including Paul Bew, as one of the crucial moments in the escalating drama that preceded the coming years of violence. On Monday 9 December 1968, the Northern Ireland prime minister, Terence O\u2019Neill, made a television appeal to moderates of every political persuasion in what became known as his \u201cUlster stands at the crossroads\u201d speech. It could be said, with hindsight, that the patrician and undoubtedly sincere O\u2019Neill fundamentally misunderstood the depth of feeling on both sides, most crucially among the more hardline unionist forces that would soon topple him.\n\nWhy put the Good Friday agreement at risk when harmony is possible? | Letters Read more\n\nBew sees it differently. \u201cOne could view the events of early 1969 as the real lost moment,\u201d he says. \u201cO\u2019Neill had come up with a modest reform programme that many on the unionist side, as well as the Catholic middle class and the church, had accepted as a step forward and a meaningful commitment to further change. Our march shattered the prospects of that change taking place.\u201d\n\nThe march Bew refers to was organised by the People\u2019s Democracy party, of which he was then a member, against the advice of the civil rights association, who thought its route too provocative. Modelled directly on Martin Luther King\u2019s Selma to Montgomery march from 1965, it began in Belfast on New Year\u2019s Day, 1969, and ended four days later in Derry, its route taking the marchers through several rural Protestant areas along the way. For Michael Farrell and the party\u2019s other young socialists it was a way of keeping the momentum of protest going in the face of reforms that they, like many in the nationalist community, thought of as too little too late.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In April 1969 21-year-old Bernadette Devlin became Britain\u2019s youngest ever female MP, winning south Derry for the People\u2019s Democracy party.

They were attacked by stone-throwing loyalists on several occasions, but nothing prepared them for what happened as they crossed Burntollet Bridge on the fourth day. Waiting in ambush was a crowd of about 200 loyalists, including off-duty members of the \u201cB-Specials\u201d (an all-Protestant auxiliary police force), who descended on the marchers with sticks, iron bars, bottles and stones. Panic ensued with protesters, including several injured women, running into the river and the nearby fields. Though 80 RUC officers had accompanied the march, they seemed unable or unwilling to provide protection. The Burntollet ambush, shown on television that evening, was etched on the nationalist psyche as another example of state collusion with loyalist mob rule. \u201cNo one did as much damage to the unionist cause as the people who attacked the marchers at Burntollet,\u201d says Bew.\n\nIn the months after, events in Northern Ireland accelerated. In early February, O\u2019Neill announced the dissolution of Stormont and a subsequent election that would signal a major schism in the unionist party. On 17 April 1969, Bernadette Devlin stood as an independent Unity candidate in Mid Ulster. Aged 21, she became the youngest woman to be elected as an MP at Westminster and made her debut with one of the most stirring speeches ever made in the House.\n\nA few days later, serious rioting broke out in Derry after clashes between civil rights protesters and loyalists, who laid siege to the nationalist Bogside area. The following month, what came to be known as the Battle of the Bogside took place when RUC officers and loyalists once again attempted to enter the area. They were met with fierce resistance from locals, many of whom had been present when the police attacked the civil rights march on Duke Street less than a year before. As Bogside residents forced the RUC out of the area and declared it Free Derry, rioting spread across Northern Ireland. The most vicious outbreak of sectarian violence erupted in Belfast, where hundreds of families were driven from their burning homes by a large loyalist mob, an event that directly led to the IRA re-forming and recruiting younger volunteers in nationalist areas. In Divis flats, a nine-year-old boy, Patrick Rooney, became the first child victim of the trouble, killed by RUC machine-gun fire as he lay sleeping. On Thursday 14 August 1969, British troops were deployed on the streets of Northern Ireland. The darkness had descended with a vengeance.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Derry youths throw petrol bombs at the RUC during the Battle of the Bogside in August 1969.

He was the first of eight people to die by violence that month, five of them killed by security forces. Gallagher had unwittingly walked into a street disturbance that followed the cancellation of a civil rights meeting in Armagh city hall due to the escalating tension. I remember the utter bewilderment felt by many in the town when news of his death spread. Already, the carnival atmosphere that had prevailed on the day of the civil rights march just nine months previously had become a distant memory.\n\nThere are those that still maintain that the people who took to the streets in peaceful protest share the blame for starting the Troubles. I, as you might have guessed, am not one of them. I leave the last word to someone from my home town who also marched on that day. \u201cIt seems to me now that we were idealistic to the point of naive in underestimating how violent the state\u2019s response would be,\u201d says Dermot Kelly. \u201cBut looking back, we were very clear in our aims. People have the right to aspire to equality in a democracy. You either believe that or you don\u2019t. And, if you do, then marching for the rights denied you by a so-called democracy seems a perfectly reasonable thing to do.\u201d\n\nThe Lost Moment exhibtion opens at the Nerve Centre, Derry on 28 April","19":"A woman cries at a hospital after she lost her son in a suicide attack on a voter registration center in Kabul, Afghanistan, Sunday, April 22, 2018.

Gen. Daud Amin, the Kabul police chief, said the suicide bomber targeted civilians who had gathered to receive national identification cards.\n\nThe large explosion echoed across the city, shattering windows miles away from the attack site and damaging several nearby vehicles. Police blocked all roads to the blast site, with only ambulances allowed in. Local TV stations broadcast live footage of hundreds of distraught people gathered at nearby hospitals seeking word about loved ones.\n\nThe Islamic State group has claimed responsibility in a statement carried by its Aamaq news agency, saying it had targeted Shiite \"apostates.\"\n\nAfghanistan will hold parliamentary elections in October.\n\nAfghans are seen through shattered windows of a voter registration center that was attacked by a suicide bomber in Kabul, Afghanistan, Sunday, April 22, 2018.

Both groups regularly launch attacks, with the Taliban usually targeting the government and security forces, and IS targeting the country's Shiite minority.\n\nBoth groups want to establish a harsh form of Islamic rule in Afghanistan, and are opposed to democratic elections.\n\nElsewhere in Afghanistan, at least five people were killed when their vehicle struck a roadside bomb in the northern Baghlan province. Zabihullah Shuja, spokesman for the provincial police chief, said four other people were wounded in Sunday's blast in Puli Khomri, the capital of the province.\n\nThe Taliban routinely target security forces and government officials with roadside bombs, which often end up killing civilians.\n\nIn the northern Balkh province, a district police chief died of his wounds after being shot Saturday during a gunbattle with insurgents, according to Sher Jan Durrani, spokesman for the provincial police chief. He said around a dozen insurgents were also killed in the battle, which is still underway.\n\nDurrani identified the slain commander as Halim Khanjar, police chief for the Char Bolak district.\n\nThe Taliban claimed responsibility for the killing."},"URL":{"0":"https:\/\/lifehacker.com\/a-gun-lingo-glossary-for-those-unfamiliar-with-firearms-1825427596","1":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/4\/25\/17275996\/cult-leaders-psychology-bhagwan-shree-rajneesh-netflix-wild-wild-country","2":"https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/inside-amds-quest-to-build-chips-that-can-beat-intel-1824064984","3":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/04\/24\/us\/gun-owners-laws-parkland.html","4":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/04\/23\/opinion\/waffle-house-shooting-nashville.html","5":"https:\/\/mashable.com\/2018\/04\/22\/james-shaw-jr-hero-waffle-house-shooting\/","6":"https:\/\/mashable.com\/2018\/04\/25\/water-pistol-emoji-google-facebook\/","7":"https:\/\/mashable.com\/2018\/04\/22\/dad-gun-joke-falls-flat\/","8":"https:\/\/mashable.com\/2018\/04\/20\/national-student-walkout-justin-blackman-not-only-one\/","9":"https:\/\/mashable.com\/2018\/04\/21\/rob-delaney-best-tweets\/","10":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/04\/20\/us\/school-walkout-students.html","11":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/04\/22\/us\/texas-walkout-student-killed.html","12":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/25\/opinions\/mick-mulvaney-delivers-the-chilling-truth-sachs\/index.html","13":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-guns\/students-to-walkout-across-the-united-states-in-call-for-gun-reforms-idUSKBN1HR1DG","14":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2018\/apr\/20\/tech-monopoly-apple-facebook-data-extreme-content","15":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2018\/apr\/20\/trump-us-syria-truth-tribal-robert-mueller-white-helmets-factse","16":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/global\/2018\/apr\/22\/amy-schumer-interview-film-i-feel-pretty-marriage-love-stand-up","17":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/politics\/2018\/apr\/20\/new-power-jeremy-heimans-social-media","18":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/politics\/2018\/apr\/22\/lost-moment-exhibition-northern-ireland-civil-rights-1968-troubles-what-if","19":"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/ap-suicide-bomber-strikes-in-afghan-capital-12-killed-2018-4"}}
